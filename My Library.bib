This paper presents an empirical study of selected ERP companies during the period 1989-2004. We investigate whether these companies experience the stages of TALC and the chasm effect as seen in other high-tech markets. Using financial data, we focus on R\&D / Marketing expenses and sales revenue of companies and apply DEA to measure efficiency and investigate the sources and level of inefficiencies in these companies. The results demonstrate that efficient companies are not just investing more in R\&D and Marketing, but are in fact managing the inputs better than the inefficient companies.},

Our study therefore aims to verify whether funds with high ESG ratings outperform funds with low ESG ratings, considering the risks taken, including higher moments, and costs borne by investors. Our analysis is carried out on a sample of 634 European mutual funds.

  abstract = {Most issue areas in world politics today are governed neither by individual institutions nor by regime complexes composed of formal interstate institutions. Rather, they are governed by ``hybrid institutional complexes'' (HICs) comprising heterogeneous interstate, infra-state, public--private and private transnational institutions, formal and informal. We develop the concept of the HIC as a novel descriptive and analytical lens for the study of contemporary global governance. The core structural difference between HICs and regime complexes is the greater diversity of institutional forms within HICs. Because of that diversity, HICs operate differently than regime complexes in two significant ways: (1) HICs exhibit relatively greater functional differentiation among their component institutions, and hence suffer from relatively fewer overlapping claims to authority; and (2) HICs exhibit greater informal hierarchy among their component institutions, and hence benefit from greater ordering. Both are systemic features. HICs have characteristic governance benefits: they offer good ``substantive fit'' for multi-faceted governance problems and good ``political fit'' for the preferences of diverse constituents; constrain conflictive cross-institutional strategies; and are conducive to mechanisms of coordination, which enhance substantive coherence. Yet HICs also pose characteristic governance risks: individual institutions may take on aspects of problems for which they are ill-suited; multiple institutions may create confusion; HICs can amplify conflict and contestation rather than constraining them; and the ``soft'' institutions within HICs can reduce the focality of incumbent treaties and intergovernmental organizations and forestall the establishment of new ones. We outline a continuing research agenda for exploring the structures, operations and governance implications of HICs.},

In their role as major global institutional investors and risk managers, insurance companies and pension funds are strategic players in building socio-economic and sustainable development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of action and research on environmental, social and governance~(ESG) factors in the insurance and pension sectors, we conduct a systematic literature review. We rely on the PRISMA protocol and analyze 1~731 academic publications available in the Web of Science database up to the year 2022 and refer to 23 studies outside of scientific research retrieved from the websites of key international and European organizations. To study the corpus of literature, we introduce a classification framework along the insurance value chain including external stakeholders. The main findings reveal that risk, underwriting and investment management are the most researched areas among the nine categories considered in our framework, while claims management and sales tend to be neglected. Regarding ESG factors, climate change, as part of the environmental factor, has received the most attention in the literature. After reviewing the literature, we summarize the main sustainability issues and potential related actions. Given the current nature of the sustainability challenges for the insurance sector, this literature review is relevant to academics and practitioners alike.},

This study aims to examine the role of intention, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and moral norms in explaining SRI behavior by investors in Malaysia. The underlying framework is the Theory of Planned Behavior (TpB) that has been modified to incorporate moral norms as an additional explanatory variable. Studies that apply TpB in their measurement of behavior indicate a mix of explanations for the relationship of constructs that influence behavior through intention which warrant further examinations. The results based on a questionnaire survey of Malaysian investors suggest that attitude, subjective norms and moral norms have positive effect on intention which in turn positively affects behavior towards SRI. The relationship for attitude, subjective norms, and moral norms to behavior is improved significantly by intention as a mediator. Based on squared multiple correlations (R2), it is found that the final structural model could explain 46\% of the variance in intention and 50\% of the variance in behavior. SRI providers and policy makers should also consider the influence of social pressure from investors' friends and relatives in their SRI decision-making. Investors' personal standards are also found to influence the intention and behavior to invest in SRI. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

By synthesising the steps of common conservation and business decision-making systems, we propose a framework to support more comprehensive development of quantitative biodiversity indicators, for a range of business contexts. The framework integrates experience from existing tried-and-tested conservation frameworks. We illustrate how our framework offers a pathway for businesses to assess their biodiversity performance and demonstrate responsible management by mitigating and reversing their biodiversity impacts and sustaining their dependencies, enabling them to demonstrate their contribution to emerging global biodiversity targets (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity post-2020 targets).},

Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports/business responsibility reports (BRR)/CSR/sustainability reports of 60 top-listed companies in India. A comprehensive sustainability reporting index is developed. Content analysis technique is used. Inter-coder reliability is established. Findings: Altogether, 18 items of the index are not disclosed by the majority of companies in India. SR quality is found significantly lower than the SR quantity. Moreover, SR practices significantly differ by dimension/category, industry-type and firm-size but are not influenced by ownership structure. However, the study fails to establish any conclusive relationship between SR and profitability. Practical implications: The present study has several implications for corporates, practitioners, policymakers and stakeholders. The findings underscore the need for amendments in the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and BRR framework of the Securities and Exchange Board of India to avoid patchy disclosures and ensure complete reporting by companies. Originality/value: This study is among the foremost studies in India evaluating SR practices of top-listed companies in the wake of the mandatory BRR requirement from a quantitative as well as qualitative perspective using a multidimensional index.},

This is especially true for copper whose consumption will increase significantly due to electrification and, therefore, understanding the associated footprint becomes essential. This study uses simulation-based life cycle assessment (LCA) together with a commercial flowsheet simulation program to compare several copper smelting technologies against each other when producing metallic blister copper from sulfide copper ore. The lowest LCA values for three concentrate compositions and three capacities were obtained for Flash Smelting technology with Peirce-Smith converting (FSF-PSC). The unit CO2 emissions decreased with increasing capacity. The reduction obtained when the capacity was doubled was 1--9\%, depending on the technology. The main source of CO2 emissions was electricity generation, including the use for oxygen production. For instance, for FSF-PSC it accounted for 91\% of the climate change when global data source was used for electricity, translating into an 80\% reduction if non-fossil electricity was introduced. A reduction of up to 85\% in climate change can be achieved by changing from the highest emission producing technology, the Side Blowing Furnace -- Top Blowing Converter (SBF-TBC), to the lowest (FSF-PSC) and by using non-fossil electricity.},

Current energy systems are primarily designed with a focus on total cost minimization and bounds on greenhouse gas emissions. Omitting planetary boundaries in energy systems design can lead to energy mixes unable to power our sustainable development. To overcome this conceptual limitation, we here incorporate planetary boundaries into energy systems models, explicitly linking energy generation with the Earth's ecological limits. Taking the United States as a testbed, we found that the least cost energy mix that would meet the Paris Agreement 2 degrees Celsius target still transgresses five out of eight planetary boundaries. It is possible to meet seven out of eight planetary boundaries concurrently by incurring a doubling of the cost compared to the least cost energy mix solution (1.3\% of the United States gross domestic product in 2017). Due to the stringent downscaled planetary boundary on biogeochemical nitrogen flow, there is no energy mix in the United States capable of satisfying all planetary boundaries concurrently. Our work highlights the importance of considering planetary boundaries in energy systems design and paves the way for further research on how to effectively accomplish such integration in energy related studies.},

In order to do this, we first propose three measures of environmental sustainability which may give financial agents information on the greenity of their investments. These alternative indicators could serve as an overall measure of environmental sustainability and overcome the drawback that limits the evaluation of green investments to the measurement of CO2 emissions while often more than one environmental aspects may be considered. Secondly, we propose some models aimed at evaluating the performance of green mutual funds by taking into account the proposed environmental measures as well as some classical financial indicators. The analysis is carried out in a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework, since DEA models can consider strategic non-financial objective measures in addition to traditional financial metrics in order to give a more balanced view of socially responsible investments (SRI). The presented models include indicators of environmental sustainability in different ways, either by penalizing a high environmental consumption or by rewarding an environmental saving entailed by a low consumption. The environmental measures and the models proposed are applied to a set of European green funds in the periods 2012--2015 and 2010--2015 to conduct an extensive analysis.},

The ``Enabling a Natural Capital Approach Guidance'' publication is seen as a comprehensive practical guide to natural capital and therefore is determined a sensible starting point on which to base this research. This research paper is not intended to be an exhaustive exploration of all biodiversity tools available, but rather is intended to identify a selection of tools which may be candidates for further research into their actuarial use case. We conclude that there are tools which merit additional research, and we recommend that these tools be further investigated to understand (i) the specific actuarial use case(s), (ii) whether the tools are applicable to direct infrastructure investments only or a broad range of asset classes, and (iii) whether their scope can be extended beyond the UK.},

This report investigates and provides a good overview of the region's efforts to mainstream natural capital and biodiversity concerns into public policy. It also provides a series of policy tools and instruments: payments for ecosystems services, innovation in managing protected areas, conserva- tion trust funds, nature-based solutions for infrastructure, small-scale sustainable fisheries man- agement, natural capital and ecosystem accounting, and ecosystem-based adaptation in agriculture. Two key lessons emerge from this report. First, mainstreaming natural capital and biodiversity considerations into day-to-day activities inevitably requires the involvement of multiple stakehold- ers (from communities to private firms) that should become central players in constructing and governing LAC's natural wealth. Still, all the tools described in this report share a common fea- ture: strong endorsement and support from government institutions, well beyond environmental authorities. Second, the lessons derived from policy tools with a longer history are evidence of the constant political, financial, and technical challenges faced by these policies for long-term sustain- ability. Although some of the policy tools described in this report have a long history, none of them can take their survival for granted. Solving the financial and technical challenges is typically the only functioning strategy to deal with political issues. The report suggests a series of key enabling conditions that facilitate mainstreaming natural capital and biodiversity considerations into public policy. 4},

In this context, this paper explores the socio-demographic characteristics of investors who choose impact investment options over traditional investments, and on the drivers promoting such choices. More specifically, the study consists of an experiment-based research in which 602 participants (non-experts and experts in the financial sector) took part in a multiple-choice game involving different investment scenarios and incentive conditions. The findings show that both expert investors and female participants are more likely to choose impact investment options and that the tendency to invest in social funds increases with age. Neither external and centrally planned incentives, such as fiscal incentives, nor the educational level of participants show a significant influence on investment choices. By contrast, information about the actual social impact achieved by funds plays a role in promoting socially oriented decisions. In this regard, visual aids appear to be an effective means of promoting impact investment.

Prior theory has shown that the effect of information transparency is ambiguous. Our study is based on two insights. Where signal space is finite, increased transparency usually destroys uniqueness of equilibria; and increasing transparency can reverse the risk-dominance ordering of equilibria. Our experiments show that increasing transparency improves coordination only when transparency makes the efficient equilibrium risk dominant. Coordination is degraded when increased transparency causes the secure equilibrium to be risk dominant. These results are consistent with subjects holding level-1 beliefs.},

  abstract = {The Anthropocene is characterized by the strengthening of planetary-scale interactions between the biophysical Earth system and human societies. This increasing social-ecological entanglement poses new challenges for studying possible future World-Earth system trajectories and World-Earth resilience defined as the capacity of the system to absorb and regenerate from anthropogenic stresses such as greenhouse gas emissions and land-use changes. The WorldEarth system is currently in a non-equilibrium transitional regime of the early Anthropocene with arguably no plausible possibilities of remaining in Holocene-like conditions while sheltering up to 10 billion humans without risk of undermining the resilience of the Earth system. We develop a framework within which to conceptualize World-Earth resilience to examine this risk. Because conventional ball-and-cup type notions of resilience are hampered by the rapid and open-ended social, cultural, economic and technological evolution of human societies, we focus on the notion of `pathway resilience', i.e. the relative number of paths that allow the World-Earth system to move from the currently occupied transitional states towards a safe and just operating space in the Anthropocene. We formalize this conceptualization mathematically and provide a foundation to explore how interactions between Earth system resilience (biophysical processes) and World system resilience (social processes) impact pathway resilience. Our analysis shows the critical importance of building Earth system resilience to reach a safe and just operating space. We also illustrate the importance of World system dynamics by showing how perceptions of fairness coupled with regional inequality affects pathway resilience. The framework provides a starting point for the analysis of World-Earth resilience that can be extended to more complex model settings as well as the development of quantitative planetary-scale resilience indicators to guide sustainable development in a stabilized Earth system.},

  abstract = {In recent years, financial and demographic conditions, including low interest rates and volatile equity markets, have been testing the endurance of pension systems. Concern about the sustainability of pension systems has prompted discussion about introducing individual choices under the collective choice mandate. An ongoing discussion seeks to provide more freedom of choice and to shift towards a more individualized risk system within the collective mandate. This suggested individualization will increase operational costs but aims to keep pensions at current levels by shifting risk onto employees. Following the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), the objective of this paper is to examine pension beneficiaries' intention to adopt a portfolio consisting of socially responsible and impact investments. We employ confirmatory factor and regression analyses to better understand pension beneficiaries' attitudes, social norms, perceived consumer effectiveness, and intentions for such a choice. Responses from 637 respondents from a Dutch pension administrative organization were collected and identified as a valid sample. Consistent with the theory, the results of our analysis revealed that attitudes and social norms positively affected individuals' intention to invest in this specific portfolio. Furthermore, we expand our model and incorporate perceived consumer effectiveness and consumer confidence as important factors influencing and moderating socially responsible behaviour, respectively. Our results imply that understanding the behavioural determinants affecting pension beneficiaries' intentions can be an effective tool for increasing their involvement in pension affairs by making their own choices. Our findings yield policy recommendations for stimulating socially responsible investment behaviour in pension beneficiaries by examining the determinants of human behaviour.},

Considering that future mineral demand is likely to increase and that the final energy consumption per unit mass of mineral extracted (energy intensities of mining) is also forecast to increase as a result of a decrease in mineral resource deposit qualities, the mining industry's final energy consumption will increase in the future. But the scale of that future increase remains unexplored. In this study, we (i) provide the first bottom-up assessment of the mining industry's final energy consumption globally (1971--2015), (ii) use 1.5{$^\circ$}C consistent socio-economic scenarios to conduct an exploratory study of future possible pathways for the mining industry's final energy consumption, and (iii) review the extent to which such energy consumption is considered in energy-economy models. We find that the mining industry is currently responsible for approximately 1.7\% of global final energy consumption. However, the mining industry's final energy consumption is likely to increase significantly, by a factor in the range 2--8 by 2060, depending on the future economic trajectory, on the evolution of energy intensities, and on future recycling rates. We also find that mineral material flows and their associated energy requirements (including the mining industry's energy consumption) are insufficiently covered in many energy-economy models. Our work suggests that the limited representation of material flows and associated energy requirements is currently an important blind spot in energy-economy modelling and may hinder the efforts of the community to build consistent energy transition pathways.},

  abstract = {Red mud is generated at a rate of up to 175.5 million tons per year. The global stockpile of red mud is near 4 billion tons. This material is hazardous with pH values from 11 to 13. Reduction of this waste is critical. Current industry practices for disposal of red mud involve different stockpiling techniques on valuable land area or disposing into critical bodies of water. This review studies processes which can reduce the negative environmental impact of red mud in an economic way. For instance, neutralization of red mud with CO2 can decrease the pH from 12.5 to 7. Treatment of red mud by this method lessens the negative environmental impact and prepares it for further processing for utilization. The current utilization rate of red mud is very low, only about 3 million tons per year are used as an additive for cement and construction. Red mud contains a large quantity of valuable minerals that can be extracted to both reduce the amount of red mud and provide value to the waste. This review investigates novel methods for treating red mud and extracting minerals like iron, titanium, and rare earth elements using a variety of smelting, direct reduction, and leaching processes. For example, the iron nugget process is a single step method to reduce iron oxides to metallic iron and separate them from red mud. Iron nuggets produced from red mud have an iron grade above 90\%, which is comparable to pig iron generated by the blast furnace.},

We find that basic behavioral patterns of cooperation and punishment in the laboratory are replicable online. The most important challenge of online interactive experiments is participant dropout. We discuss measures for reducing dropout and show that, for our case study, dropouts are exogenous to the experiment. We conclude that data quality for interactive experiments via the Internet is adequate and reliable, making online interactive experimentation a potentially valuable complement to laboratory studies.},

  abstract = {Conventional, neoclassical economics assumes perfectly rational agents (firms, consumers, investors) who face well-defined problems and arrive at optimal behaviour consistent with --- in equilibrium with --- the overall outcome caused by this behaviour. This rational, equilibrium system produces an elegant economics, but is restrictive and often unrealistic. Complexity economics relaxes these assumptions. It assumes that agents differ, that they have imperfect information about other agents and must, therefore, try to make sense of the situation they face. Agents explore, react and constantly change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create. The resulting outcome may not be in equilibrium and may display patterns and emergent phenomena not visible to equilibrium analysis. The economy becomes something not given and existing but constantly forming from a developing set of actions, strategies and beliefs --- something not mechanistic, static, timeless and perfect but organic, always creating itself, alive and full of messy vitality.},

The chapters in this work cover the fundamental concepts, principles, approaches, methods and models for how to understand, assess, communicate, manage and govern risk. These topics are presented and examined in a way which details how they relate, for example, how to characterize and communicate risk with particular emphasis on reflecting uncertainties; how to distinguish risk perception and professional risk judgments; how to assess risk and guide decision-makers, especially for cases involving large uncertainties and value differences; and how to integrate risk assessment with resilience-based strategies. The text provides a variety of examples and case studies that relate to highly visible and relevant issues facing risk academics, practitioners and non-risk leaders who must make risk-related decisions.  Presenting both the foundational and most recent advancements in the subject matter, this work particularly suits students of risk science courses at college and university level. The book also~provides broader key reading for students and scholars in other domains, including business, engineering and public health.},

  abstract = {This article charts the evolution of the divestment movement, a transnational advocacy network that uses a range of strategies to shame, pressure, facilitate, and encourage investors in general, and large institutional investors in particular, to relinquish their holdings of fossil fuel stocks in favour of climate-friendly alternatives. It describes the movement's central characteristics and the strategies it employs, it maps its basic architecture and the potential role it plays in the broader climate change regime complex, and shows how it represents a novel form of private investor-targeted climate change governance, operating primarily through symbolic political action and as a norm entrepreneur. Given the potential importance of the movement, the model it may provide for other forms of private governance, and the paucity of analysis of its implications for climate change mitigation, this article addresses an important descriptive and analytical gap in the climate policy literature. Policy relevance The early success and rapid growth of the divestment movement suggests it may play a significant role within the broader sphere of climate change policy. This article shows how the movement has used the aggregation, packaging, and dissemination of scientific fact and moral argument, and local and international campaigning, direct action, lobbying, and knowledge construction to steer the actions of investors. More broadly it demonstrates how shaming, persuasion, and empowerment can be used as strategies to bring about economic and political change and to catalyse the `energy revolution' that many see as the essence of effective climate change mitigation. In so doing, the article indicates how climate policy can be advanced by novel forms of private governance, and (so its proponents would argue) how more might be achieved by unconventional means and leveraging the private sector than governments have managed by conventional means in some two decades.},

  abstract = {Background: Problem-based learning (PBL) as an educational approach has been adopted by medical and health sciences faculties worldwide. Successful implementation of these curricula may, however, end a few years later with several problems reflecting cracks in curriculum maintenance. Aims: The aim of this article is to discuss these problems, their possible causes and what action can be taken to maintain effective curriculum delivery. Methods: We reviewed the current literature, recent Association for Medical Education in Europe conferences' sessions on PBL, explored curriculum design approaches and problems (cracks) identified in PBL programs that may occur a few years after successful implementation. We have also reflected on our collective experience in a number of universities to develop these tips. Results: Incorporating the methods described, we have developed the following 12 tips: (1) Pay attention to training new staff for PBL, (2) Maintain the briefing/debriefing sessions, (3) Review the PBL material and program in light of the previous year's feedback, (4) Monitor the delivery of the program, (5) Review management of the PBL program, (6) Encourage research and publications in PBL, (7) Ensure that assessment reflects PBL principles, (8) Refrain from adding new lectures to the timetable, (9) Reward contributions to on-going curriculum maintenance, (10) Provide on-going and advanced professional development tutor training, (11) Make explicit (and develop) students' skills required for PBL and (12) Attend to conflict and group dysfunction. Conclusions: Being vigilant of possible cracks (erosion) in the PBL curriculum that may occur a few years after successful implementation is mandatory. Erosion of PBL can be minimized or avoided if these tips can be applied.},

  abstract = {Carbon offsets are widely used by individuals, corporations, and governments to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions on the assumption that offsets reflect equivalent climate benefits achieved elsewhere. These climate-equivalence claims depend on offsets providing real and additional climate benefits beyond what would have happened, counterfactually, without the offsets project. Here, we evaluate the design of California's prominent forest carbon offsets program and demonstrate that its climate-equivalence claims fall far short on the basis of directly observable evidence. By design, California's program awards large volumes of offset credits to forest projects with carbon stocks that exceed regional averages. This paradigm allows for adverse selection, which could occur if project developers preferentially select forests that are ecologically distinct from unrepresentative regional averages. By digitizing and analyzing comprehensive offset project records alongside detailed forest inventory data, we provide direct evidence that comparing projects against coarse regional carbon averages has led to systematic over-crediting of 30.0 million tCO2e (90\% CI: 20.5--38.6 million tCO2e) or 29.4\% of the credits we analyzed (90\% CI: 20.1\%--37.8\%). These excess credits are worth an estimated {\textbackslash}410 million (90\% CI: {\textbackslash}280--\$528 million) at recent market prices. Rather than improve forest management to store additional carbon, California's forest offsets program creates incentives to generate offset credits that do not reflect real climate benefits.},

Our measure incorporates parameter uncertainty in its measurement and through a sequence of pair-wise comparisons of the style exposures determines both the number of misclassified mutual funds and their style deviation levels. We also examine the relation between the level of style deviation and fund performance on a long- term basis. Using a sample of 1,866 US equity funds over the 2003-2016 period we document that: (i) about 14\% of individual funds are significantly misclassified, (ii) in the long run misclassified funds significantly underperform well-classified funds by 0.92\% per year based on alpha from the Carhart model, and (iii) misclassified funds appear to be younger, smaller in size and charge higher expense ratios. We also find strong persistence in the style deviation for up to 7 years into the future, which suggests that the style deviation is not driven by fund manager's negligence. The results of this study are substantially important for investors who follow a buy- and- hold approach rather than a short-term performance chasing strategy and suggest that maintaining a consistent style is a crucial ingredient for achieving good long-term risk-adjusted performance.},

  abstract = {The field of Financial Networks is a paramount example of the novel applications of Statistical Physics that have made possible by the present data revolution. As the total value of the global financial market has vastly outgrown the value of the real economy, financial institutions on this planet have created a web of interactions whose size and topology calls for a quantitative analysis by means of Complex Networks. Financial Networks are not only a playground for the use of basic tools of statistical physics as ensemble representation and entropy maximization; rather, their particular dynamics and evolution triggered theoretical advancements as the definition of DebtRank to measure the impact and diffusion of shocks in the whole systems. In this review we present the state of the art in this field, starting from the different definitions of financial networks (based either on loans, on assets ownership, on contracts involving several parties -- such as credit default swaps, to multiplex representation when firms are introduced in the game and a link with real economy is drawn) and then discussing the various dynamics of financial contagion as well as applications in financial network inference and validation. We believe that this analysis is particularly timely since financial stability as well as recent innovations in climate finance, once properly analysed and understood in terms of complex network theory, can play a pivotal role in the transformation of our society towards a more sustainable world.},

  abstract = {Optimizing economic welfare in environmental governance has been criticized for delivering short-term gains at the expense of long-term environmental degradation. Different from economic optimization, the concepts of sustainability and the more recent safe operating space have been used to derive policies in environmental governance. However, a formal comparison between these three policy paradigms is still missing, leaving policy makers uncertain which paradigm to apply. Here, we develop a better understanding of their interrelationships, using a stylized model of human-environment tipping elements. We find that no paradigm guarantees fulfilling requirements imposed by another paradigm and derive simple heuristics for the conditions under which these trade-offs occur. We show that the absence of such a master paradigm is of special relevance for governing real-world tipping systems such as climate, fisheries, and farming, which may reside in a parameter regime where economic optimization is neither sustainable nor safe.},

Subjects do not employ the ``replacement excuse'' if a social norm exists that classifies the selfish action as immoral. But if no social norm exists, subjects are more inclined to take a selfish action in situations where another subject can otherwise take it. By demonstrating the importance of social norms of moral behavior for limiting the power of the replacement excuse, our paper informs the long-standing debate on the effect of markets on morals.},

  abstract = {The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (US SIF) defines socially responsible investing (SRI) as an investment discipline that considers environmental, social and corporate governance criteria to generate long-term, competitive financial returns and positive societal impact (US SIF, 2016a). In contrast, conventional investing strategies aim to generate longterm competitive financial returns but do not consider societal impact. Recent trend reports estimate that the total value of US-domiciled assets under management using SRI strategies is \$8.72 trillion (US SIF, 2016a), while in Europe it is more than {\texteuro}10 trillion (Eurosif, 2016). Consequently, the importance of SRI is considerable to both academics and practitioners, as is the influence that this form of investing can have on the practices of major corporations. This dissertation analyses whether behavioural economic theory and theory relating to psychological biases can potentially be utilised in the promotion of SRI to increase the quantity of capital being invested through SRI strategies. The analysis finds that the way SRI decisions are framed can significantly affect the propensity with which investors choose to invest through SRI strategies and that the promoters of SRI, can potentially utilise framing and choice architecture to increase the prevalence of this form of investing. This important finding enhances the current academic and practitioner literature relating to SRI, whilst also adding additional depth to the literature pertaining to behavioural economics.},

Although it does not have a single, consensual definition, the bioeconomy encompasses various bio-based value chains and economic activities relying on biodiversity. How these burgeoning developments may affect biodiversity, however, still needs further examination. This article explores the bioeconomy--biodiversity nexus through the lens of nature's contributions to people (NCPs). Drawing from the bioeconomy literature and Amazonian experiences, we argue that the bioeconomy may: (i) help conserve or restore habitats, (ii) improve knowledge on biodiversity, (iii) valorize livelihoods and increase social participation, and (iv) aid in moving beyond the commodification of nature. However, none of these achievements can be taken for granted. To date, the bioeconomy has focused mainly on extracting goods from nature (e.g., food, energy, or biochemicals), often at the expense of NCPs that require integral ecosystems and are decisive for a sustainable society in the longer run. Moreover, we assert that it is critical to discern the beneficiaries of various contributions, as ``people'', in reality, are composed of distinct groups that relate differently to nature and have different preferences regarding trade-offs. The NCPs framework can help broaden synergies in the bioeconomy--biodiversity nexus, but inclusive governance remains critical.},

We develop a network-based climate stress-test methodology and apply it to large Euro Area banks in a `green' and a `brown' scenario. We find that direct and indirect exposures to climate-policy-relevant sectors represent a large portion of investors' equity portfolios, especially for investment and pension funds. Additionally, the portion of banks' loan portfolios exposed to these sectors is comparable to banks' capital. Our results suggest that climate policy timing matters. An early and stable policy framework would allow for smooth asset value adjustments and lead to potential net winners and losers. In contrast, a late and abrupt policy framework could have adverse systemic~consequences.},

  abstract = {Climate change has been recently recognised as a new source of risk for the financial system. Over the last years, several central banks and financial supervisors have recommended investors and financial institutions to assess their exposure to climate-related financial risks. Central banks and financial supervisors have also started to design scenarios for climate stress tests - to- assess how vulnerable the financial system is to climate change. Nevertheless, the financial community falls short of methodologies that allow the successful analysis of the risks that climate change poses to financial stability. Indeed, the characteristics of climate risks (i.e., deep uncertainty, non-linearity and endogeneity) challenge traditional approaches to macroeconomic and financial risk analysis. Embedding climate change in macroeconomic and financial analysis using innovative perspectives is fundamental for a comprehensive understanding of the macrofinancial relevance of climate change. This Special Issue is devoted to the relation between climate risks and financial stability and represents the first comprehensive attempt to fill methodological gaps in this area and to shed light on the financial implications of climate change. It includes original contributions that use a range of methodologies -- such as network modelling, dynamic evolutionary macroeconomic modelling and financial econometrics -- to analyse climate-related financial risks and the implications of financial policies and instruments aiming at the low-carbon transition. The research insights of these contributions can inform the decisions of central banks and financial supervisors about the integration of climate change considerations into their policies and financial risk assessment.},

To this end, we develop a novel climate credit risk model (CLIMACRED) for climate scenario-contingent valuation, linking the firm's default probability to the climate scenarios developed by financial authorities. Transition risk emerges from changes in markets' expectations about the materialization of climate transition scenarios, which lead to adjustments in the firms' default probability and in the value of their corporate bonds. We derive closed-form expressions for the ad- justments in firms' default probability considering asset-level technology, and for the value of issued bonds and equities. Our results show that valuation adjustments vary greatly with the severity of adjustments in market expectations, decarbonization scenarios and the energy technology composition of the firms' revenues. Losses in equity values can range up to 80\% for firms focusing on fossil fuel activities, but can be much lower for firms with diversified energy technology profiles.},

Our data show that almost half of the clients invest exclusively at these banks, whereas the other half also holds at least one conventional investment account. Clients vary widely in the extent to which they identify themselves with socially responsible investments (SRI). Investors with a strong social identification allocate substantially more of their wealth to these banks, both in terms of euros invested and in terms of percentage of their total portfolio invested. Social identification also mediates the effect of expected returns on SRI. Our results further show that social identification is stronger among highly educated, younger and low-wealth investors.},

  abstract = {Energy is crucial for supporting basic human needs, development and well-being. The future evolution of the scale and character of the energy system will be fundamentally shaped by socioeconomic conditions and drivers, available energy resources, technologies of energy supply and transformation, and end-use energy demand. However, because energy-related activities are significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental and social externalities, energy system development will also be influenced by social acceptance and strategic policy choices. All of these uncertainties have important implications for many aspects of economic and environmental sustainability, and climate change in particular. In the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) framework these uncertainties are structured into five narratives, arranged according to the challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this study we explore future energy sector developments across the five SSPs using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), and we also provide summary output and analysis for selected scenarios of global emissions mitigation policies. The mitigation challenge strongly corresponds with global baseline energy sector growth over the 21st century, which varies between 40\% and 230\% depending on final energy consumer behavior, technological improvements, resource availability and policies. The future baseline CO2-emission range is even larger, as the most energy-intensive SSP also incorporates a comparatively high share of carbon-intensive fossil fuels, and vice versa. Inter-regional disparities in the SSPs are consistent with the underlying socioeconomic assumptions; these differences are particularly strong in the SSPs with large adaptation challenges, which have little inter-regional convergence in long-term income and final energy demand levels. The scenarios presented do not include feedbacks of climate change on energy sector development. The energy sector SSPs with and without emissions mitigation policies are introduced and analyzed here in order to contribute to future research in climate sciences, mitigation analysis, and studies on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability.},

First, we study whether affected funds increase their sustainability compared to a control group. Second, we examine if the regulation makes individual investors allocate more capital into more sustainable funds. In a difference-in-differences setting, we analyze the influence of the regulation on ESG fund scores and fund net inflows. Our results show that affected funds increase their sustainability rating after the policy intervention. Additionally, we find that a better ESG label leads to larger fund net inflows.},

According to the theory, the extra cost of such products is a signal of social status and wealth and leads to advantages in social interactions for the signaler. A previous study found positive evidence for the case of luxury brand labels. However, an issue of this study was that some of the experiments were not conducted in a perfectly double-blind manner. I resolved this by replicating variations of the original design in a double-blind procedure. Additionally, besides the luxury label condition, I introduced a "green" label condition. Thus, the hypothesis that signaling theory is able to explain pro-environmental behavior was tested for the first time in a natural field setting. Further, I conducted experiments in both average and below-average socioeconomic neighborhoods, where, according to signaling theory, the effects of luxury signals should be even stronger. In contrast to the original study, I did not find positive effects of the luxury brand label in any of the five experiments. Nor did I find evidence for a green-signaling effect. Moreover, in poor neighborhoods a negative tendency of the luxury label actually became evident. This suggests that a signaling theory explanation of costly labels must take into account the characteristics of the observers, e.g. their social status.},

In particular, the required sample is much larger than that needed for analyses of univariate extremes. We demonstrate that Single Model Initial-condition Large Ensemble (SMILE) simulations from multiple climate models, which provide hundreds to thousands of years of weather conditions, are crucial for advancing our assessments of compound events and constructing robust model projections. Combining SMILEs with an improved physical understanding of compound events will ultimately provide practitioners and stakeholders with the best available information on climate risks.},

  abstract = {Teaching as a system Teaching and learning take place in a whole system, which embraces classroom, departmental and institutional levels. A 'poor' system is one in which the components are not integrated, and are not tuned to support high-level learning. In such a system, only the 'academic' students use higher-order learning processes. In a 'good' system, all aspects of teaching and assessment are tuned to support high-level learning, so that all students are encouraged to use higher-order learning processes. Constructive alignment (CA) is such a system. It is an approach to curriculum design that optimizes the conditions for quality learning. For an example of a poor system, here is what a psychology undergraduate said about his teaching: I hate to say it, but what you have got to do is to have a list of 'facts'; you write down ten important points and memorize those, then you'll do all right in the test ... If you can give a bit of factual information -- so and so did that, and concluded that -- for two sides of writing, then you'll get a good mark. Quoted in Ramsden (1984: 144) The problem here is not the student. In fact, this student liked writing extended essays, and finally graduated with First Class Honours, but he was contemptuous of these quick and snappy assessments. So in psychology, he made a strategic decision to memorize, knowing that it was enough to get him through, saving his big guns for his major subject. The problem here is the assessment: it was not aligned to the aims of teaching. So often the rhetoric in courses and programmes is all that it should be, stating for example that students will graduate with a deep understanding of the discipline, and the ability to solve problems creatively. Then they are told about creative problem solving in packed lecture halls, and tested with multiple-choice tests. It's all out of kilter, but such a situation is not, I strongly suspect, all that uncommon.},

Data for our empirical analysis come from the Vigeo Database for the non-financial characteristics, and from the Morningstar Database for the rest of the necessary data. The results of the empirical study shows that there is a direct and statistically significant relationship between the SRI label and the market value of mutual funds during the studied period.

  abstract = {Companies are increasingly encouraged to frame their sustainability activities and communication around ecological limits, as captured by concepts such as planetary boundaries, climate tipping points or regenerative capacity. Ecological limits may serve as scientific basis for defining environmental sustainability targets at the company level and, moreover, inspire companies to align their product portfolios with emerging societal needs related to sustainable transformations. Although corporate environmental reporting is widely researched, little attention has, hitherto, been given to company use of the ecological limits concepts in stakeholder communication. This study presents a comprehensive review of references made to ecological limits in corporate responsibility (CR) reports in 2000--2014. An exhaustive list of terms related to ecological limits was developed and used to search the CorporateRegister database, which contained approximately 40,000 CR reports from this time period. For every identified reference, we analyzed the context in which the ecological limit term was used in the CR report. We found a 10-fold increase in the number of references made to ecological limits in CR reports during the period 2000--2014. The number of CR reports published in this time period has also increased at a similar rate. Hence, the proportion of companies referring to ecological limits in their CR reports has over the years remained stable; roughly 5\%. The most commonly invoked ecological limits were related to climate change and references to ``2{$^\circ$}C'' were by far the most frequent. The vast majority of companies referring to ecological limits did so without specific references to ongoing or planned changes in their activities as a consequence of recognizing these limits. Only a small percentage, predominately high-tech companies (31 in total), explicitly used ecological limits to define targets for resource consumption, emissions reductions and/or as a stated reason for adjusting their product portfolio. In defining targets for resource consumption or emissions, only a few CR reports dealt explicitly with the issue of allocating resource and emission rights within ecological limits amongst companies and other actors. A longitudinal study of three companies showed that these did not directly report progress towards planned changes based on ecological limits and offered explanations as to why some companies abandoned planned changes altogether. Our findings provide novel insights into the current use of the ecological limits concept by companies and may be useful for actors trying to motivate companies to align their activities with the finite nature of Earth's natural systems.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The planetary boundaries framework contains regional boundaries in addition to global boundaries. Geographically resolved methods to assess regional environmental impacts are therefore needed. Existing planetary boundaries-based life cycle assessment (PB-LCA) methods have limited geographical resolution or are not applicable to full product systems, due to high spatial requirements on inventory data. Here, we enable PB-LCA of full product systems across a comprehensive set of regional and global PB impact categories. Methods: We propose comparing environmental impacts of individual processes within a product system to assigned shares of regional or global safe operating space (SOS). This is followed by aggregation of process-level results so that accumulated exceedance of assigned SOS is derived across the entire life cycle. We then present a procedure for aggregating geographically resolved characterization factors (CFs) and SOS to country, continent and global levels, ensuring compatibility with typical life cycle inventory results. We then apply the new techniques to a model laundry case study. It involves 61 selected processes, two geographically resolved PB-LCA methods, related to impacts from freshwater use and nitrogen emissions, and a largely spatially generic PB-LCA method that covers a comprehensive set of impact categories. Results and discussion: The calculation of accumulated exceedance of assigned SOS may help inform decisions about where in a life cycle to focus impact reduction efforts most urgently. The number of case study processes that exceed their assigned SOS differs when applying the geographically resolved methods, as opposed to the largely spatially generic method. Case study results differ greatly across PB-LCA impact categories, reaffirming the importance of covering a comprehensive set. Geographically resolved methods are needed for all regional impact categories and software support would be advantageous. Existing methods will require periodic updates to reflect ongoing advancements in PB science. Best practice approaches or a consensus for assigning regional SOS to processes are needed. Conclusions and outlook: Our study provides a step towards greater operability of geographically resolved PB-LCA methods by enabling application to a full product system within an assessment that covers a comprehensive set of impact categories. The case study application shows potential advantages of the process-level approach and points to the need for quantifying uncertainties in such assessments. Future studies should seek to explore the potential role of PB-LCA in decision support compared with conventional LCA.},

The article aims at assessing the effectiveness of a role-play in addressing two concerns: clarifying the concept of sustainable development and teaching sustainable development issues.Method. The effectiveness of the role-play is gauged by surveying students to reveal how the game matches a set of significant learning criteria defined by Fink.Structure of the article. First, our article provides a short overview of how the concept of sustainable development has emerged and spread over time. Second, in order to assess the learning potential of our role-play, we examine how it addresses the six components of Fink's taxonomy of significant learning: (a) foundational knowledge, (b) application, (c) integration, (d) human dimensions, (e) caring, and (f) learning how to learn.Results. The assessment shows that our role-play is highly praised by the players as it not only brings them foundational knowledge, but also allows them to enhance many skills.Conclusion. The framework of the role-play contributes to educating about sustainable development as well as educating for sustainable development.},

Awareness of this has spurred policymakers to develop an expanding network of ocean governance instruments, catalyzed civil society pressure on the public and private sector, and motivated engagement by the general public as consumers and constituents. Among local communities, diverse examples of stewardship have rested on the foundation of care, knowledge and agency. But does an analog for stewardship exist in the context of globally active multinational corporations? Here, we consider the seafood industry and its efforts to navigate this new reality through private governance. We examine paradigmatic events in the history of the sustainable seafood movement, from seafood boycotts in the 1970s through to the emergence of certification measures, benchmarks, and diverse voluntary environmental programs. We note four dimensions of stewardship in which efforts by actors within the seafood industry have aligned with theoretical concepts of stewardship, which we describe as (1) moving beyond compliance, (2) taking a systems perspective, (3) living with uncertainty, and (4) understanding humans as embedded elements of the biosphere. In conclusion, we identify emerging stewardship challenges for the seafood industry and suggest the urgent need to embrace a broader notion of ocean stewardship that extends beyond seafood.},

  abstract = {Resent research has identified the existence of social networks as a common and important denominator in cases where different stakeholders have come together to effectively deal with natural resource problems and dilemmas. It has even been shown that social networks can be more important than the existence of formal institutions for effective enforcement and compliance with environmental regulations. However, all social networks are not created equal. On the contrary, the structural pattern of relations (i.e. the topology) of a social network can have significant impact on how actors actually behave. This clearly has implications for actors' abilities to manage environmental challenges. This review aims to add more precision to initial insights and pending hypotheses about the positive impacts of social networks on governance processes and outcomes, by reviewing and synthesizing empirically based literature explicitly studying structural characteristics of social networks in natural resource governance settings. It is shown that significant differences in governance processes and outcomes can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization. Furthermore, the review shows that none of these structural characteristics present a monotonically increasing positive effect on processes of importance for resource governance, and that favoring one characteristic likely occurs at the expense of another. Thus, assessing the most favorable level and mix of different network characteristics, where most of the positive governance effects are obtained while undesired effects are minimized, presents a key research and governance challenge. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Under this paradigm, a deeper understanding of if, when, and how collaboration is effective, and when other means of addressing environmental problems are better suited, is needed. Interdisciplinary research on collaborative networks demonstrates that which actors get involved, with whom they collaborate, and in what ways they are tied to the structures of the ecosystems have profound implications on actors' abilities to address different types of environmental problems.},

Network approaches for conceptualizing and analysing these interdependencies offer one promising solution. Here, we present two advances we argue are needed to further this area of research: (i) a typology of causal assumptions explicating the causal aims of any given network-centric study of social--ecological interdependencies; (ii) unifying research design considerations that facilitate conceptualizing exactly what is interdependent, through what types of relationships and in relation to what kinds of environmental problems. The latter builds on the appreciation that many environmental problems draw from a set of core challenges that re-occur across contexts. We demonstrate how these advances combine into a comparative heuristic that facilitates leveraging case-specific findings of social--ecological interdependencies to generalizable, yet context-sensitive, theories based on explicit assumptions of causal relationships.},

It uses a top-down modelling tool developed by Ortec Finance in partnership with Cambridge Econometrics that combines climate science with macro-economic and financial effects to examine the possible impacts of three plausible (not extreme) climate pathways. The paper first considers the impact on gross domestic product (GDP), finding that GDP is lower in all three pathways, with the most severe reduction in the Failed Transition Pathway where the Paris Agreement climate targets are not met. The model then translates these GDP impacts into financial market effects. In the Failed Transition Pathway, cumulative global equity returns are approximately 50\% lower over the period 2020--2060 than in the climate-uninformed base case. For the other two pathways where the Paris Agreement targets are met, the corresponding figures are 15\% and 25\% lower returns than in the base case. Results are provided for other asset classes too. These demonstrate that climate change represents a significant market risk, with implications for financial planning, modelling and regulation.},

  abstract = {The central role of forests in climate change mitigation, as recognized in the Paris agreement, makes it increasingly important to develop and test methods for monitoring and evaluating the carbon effectiveness of REDD+. Over the last decade, hundreds of subnational REDD+ initiatives have emerged, presenting an opportunity to pilot and compare different approaches to quantifying impacts on carbon emissions. This study (1) develops a Before-After-Control-Intervention (BACI) method to assess the effectiveness of these REDD+ initiatives; (2) compares the results at the meso (initiative) and micro (village) scales; and (3) compares BACI with the simpler Before-After (BA) results. Our study covers 23 subnational REDD+ initiatives in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia and Vietnam. As a proxy for deforestation, we use annual tree cover loss. We aggregate data into two periods (before and after the start of each initiative). Analysis using control areas (`control-intervention') suggests better REDD+ performance, although the effect is more pronounced at the micro than at the meso level. Yet, BACI requires more data than BA, and is subject to possible bias in the before period. Selection of proper control areas is vital, but at either scale is not straightforward. Low absolute deforestation numbers and peak years influence both our BA and BACI results. In principle, BACI is superior, with its potential to effectively control for confounding factors. We conclude that the more local the scale of performance assessment, the more relevant is the use of the BACI approach. For various reasons, we find overall minimal impact of REDD+ in reducing deforestation on the ground thus far. Incorporating results from micro and meso level monitoring into national reporting systems is important, since overall REDD+ impact depends on land use decisions on the ground.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to assess freshwater-related impacts according to a new water footprint framework formalized in the ISO 14046 standard. To date, no consensus-based approach exists for applying this standard and results are not always comparable when different scarcity or stress indicators are used for characterization of impacts. This paper presents the outcome of a 2-year consensus building process by the Water Use in Life Cycle Assessment (WULCA), a working group of the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, on a water scarcity midpoint method for use in LCA and for water scarcity footprint assessments. Methods: In the previous work, the question to be answered was identified and different expert workshops around the world led to three different proposals. After eliminating one proposal showing low relevance for the question to be answered, the remaining two were evaluated against four criteria: stakeholder acceptance, robustness with closed basins, main normative choice, and physical meaning. Results and discussion: The recommended method, AWARE, is based on the quantification of the relative available water remaining per area once the demand of humans and aquatic ecosystems has been met, answering the question ``What is the potential to deprive another user (human or ecosystem) when consuming water in this area?'' The resulting characterization factor (CF) ranges between 0.1 and 100 and can be used to calculate water scarcity footprints as defined in the ISO standard. Conclusions: After 8~years of development on water use impact assessment methods, and 2~years of consensus building, this method represents the state of the art of the current knowledge on how to assess potential impacts from water use in LCA, assessing both human and ecosystem users' potential deprivation, at the midpoint level, and provides a consensus-based methodology for the calculation of a water scarcity footprint as per ISO 14046.},

After presenting the case of Impact Equity (section 1), the article details the norms and devices through which impact investing is constructed in everyday finan- cial work (sections 2 and 3) and investigates how impact investors mobilise moral beliefs and strategic motivations to navigate competing definitions of ``social impact'' (section 4). In doing so, this article outlines how the construc- tion of the sector has involved the creation of channels enabling capital and ``social impact'' to circulate between institutional investors, impact investment funds, and ``impactful businesses,'' and it highlights the historical tensions that this process has involved.},

An increase in the benefits of coordination leads to improved coordination, but large increases have no more impact than small increases. Once subjects have coordinated on a higher effort level, reductions in the incentives to coordinate have little effect on behavior. (JEL C92, D23, J31, L23, M52)},

However, science-based and transparent solutions to assess climate physical risks are limited, compounding the adaptation gap. This is a main limitation to fill the adaptation gap. We provide a methodology that quantifies physical risks on geolocalized productive assets, considering their exposure to chronic and acute impacts (hurricanes) across the scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Then, we translate asset-level shocks into economic and financial losses. We apply the methodology to Mexico, a country highly exposed to physical risks, recipient of adaptation finance and foreign investments. We show that investor losses are underestimated up to 70\% when neglecting asset-level information, and up to 82\% when neglecting tail acute risks. Therefore, neglecting the asset-level and acute dimensions of physical risks leads to large errors in the identification of adaptation policy responses, investments and finance tools aimed to build resilience to climate change.},

They are considered powerful educational settings for building students' sustainability expertise.

Only few studies exist that compare and appraise PPBL courses internationally against a synthesized body of the literature to create an evidence base for designing PPBL courses. This article introduces a framework for PPBL courses in sustainability and reviews PPBL practice in six programs around the world (Europe, North America, Australia). Data was collected through semi-structured qualitative interviews with course instructors and program officers, as well as document analysis. Findings indicate that the reviewed PPBL courses are of high quality and carefully designed. Each PPBL course features innovative approaches to partnerships between the university and private organizations, extended peer-review, and the role of knowledge brokers.  Yet, the findings also indicate weaknesses including paucity of critical learning objectives, solution-oriented research methodology, and follow-up research on implementation. Through the comparative design, the study reveals improvement strategies for the identified challenges and provides guidance for design and redesign of PPBL courses.},

The primary novelty of the paper is the development of a computational environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) model for coal mining operations and the application of the model for coal mining operations in Poland. The LCA model enables the assessment of environmental indicators for all identified unit processes in hard coal mines with the life cycle approach. The proposed model enables the assessment of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) based on the IPCC method and the assessment of damage categories, such as human health, ecosystems and resources based on the ReCiPe method. The model enables the assessment of GHGs for hard coal mining operations in three time frames: 20, 100 and 500 years. The model was used to evaluate the coal mines in Poland. It was demonstrated that the largest environmental impacts in damage categories were associated with the use of fossil fuels, methane emissions and the use of electricity, processing of wastes, heat, and steel supports. It was concluded that an environmental assessment of coal mining operations, apart from direct influence from processing waste, methane emissions and drainage water, should include the use of electricity, heat and steel, particularly for steel supports. Because the model allows the comparison of environmental impact assessment for various unit processes, it can be used for all hard coal mines, not only in Poland but also in the world.

Then, we randomize whether the second member of the pair: (1) receives no information about the first member, or (2) is informed of the first member's desire to purchase the asset and the result of the randomization that determined possession. This allows us to estimate the effects of learning plus possession, and learning alone, relative to a (no information) control group. We find that both social learning and social utility channels have statistically and economically significant effects on investment decisions. Evidence from a follow-up survey reveals that social learning effects are greatest when the first (second) investor is financially sophisticated (financially unsophisticated); investors report updating their beliefs about asset quality after learning about their peer's revealed preference; and, they report motivations consistent with "keeping up with the Joneses" when learning about their peer's possession of the asset. These results can help shed light on the mechanisms underlying herding behavior in financial markets and peer effects in consumption and investment decisions.},

  abstract = {This article explores the role of financial markets for sustainable development. More specifically, the authors ask to what extent financial markets foster and facilitate more sustainable business practices. The authors highlight that their current role is rather modest and conclude that, on the old paths, a paradoxical situation exists. On one hand, financial market participants increasingly integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into their investment decisions, whereas on the other hand, in terms of organizational reality, there seems to be no real shift toward more sustainable business practices. The authors identify two main challenges within the field of sustainable investments that are relevant for entering new avenues that may help overcome this situation. First, a reorientation toward a long-term paradigm for sustainable investments is important. Second, ESG data must become more trustworthy. From a theoretical point of view, the authors finally highlight the potential market consequences when ESG investment criteria are used.},

The latest inflationary term is impact investments---investments that focus on real-world changes in terms of solving social challenges and/or mitigating ecological degradation. At the core of this definition is an emphasis on transformational changes. However, the term impact investment is often used interchangeably for any investment that incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects. In the latter instance, achieving transformational change is not the main purpose of such investments, which therefore carries the risk of impact washing (akin to ``green washing''). To offer (re-)orientation from an academic perspective, we derive a new typology of sustainable investments. This typology delivers a precise definition of what impact investments are and what they should cover. As one central contribution, we propose distinguishing between impact-aligned investments and impact-generating investments. Based on these insights, we hope to lay the foundation for future research and debates in the field of impact investing by practitioners, policymakers, and academics alike.},

In turn, investors provide vital leverage on companies. Here, we report on our transdisciplinary science/business experience in applying the planetary boundaries framework (sensu Rockstr{\"o}m et al., Ecol Soc 14, 2009) to define a boundary-compatible investment universe and analyse the environmental compatibility of companies. We translate the planetary boundaries into limits for resource use and emissions per unit of economic value creation, using indicators from the Carnegie Mellon University EIO-LCA database. The resulting precautionary `economic intensities' can be compared with the current levels of companies' environmental impact. This necessarily involves simplifying assumptions, for which dialogue between biophysical science, corporate sustainability and investment perspectives is needed. The simplifications mean that our translation is transparent from both biophysical and financial viewpoints, and allow our approach to be responsive to future developments in scientific insights about planetary boundaries. Our approach enables both sub-industries and individual companies to be screened against the planetary boundaries. Our preliminary application of this screening to the entire background universe of all investable stock-listed companies gives a selectivity of two orders of magnitude for an investment universe of environmentally attractive stocks. We discuss implications for an expanded role of environmental change science in the development of thematic equity funds.},

This study uses an enhanced multiregional input-output database (REX, Resolved EXIOBASE) and supply chain impact mapping (SCIM) method to assess global biodiversity loss associated with mining-related land use. We identify hotspots in the supply chain of mining products, compare the impact of fossil and renewable electricity, and estimate the share of mining in total global impacts. We found that half of the global mining-related biodiversity loss occurs in Indonesia, Australia, and New Caledonia. Major international trade flows of embodied biodiversity loss involve Indonesia's coal exports to China and India, New Caledonia's nickel exports to Japan and Australia, and Australia's iron and bauxite exports to China. Key end-consumers include China's growing infrastructure and the EU's and USA's household consumption. Electricity generation accounted for 10\% of global mining-related biodiversity loss in 2014. The impact of coal-fired electricity was 10 times higher than that of renewables per unit of electricity generated. Globally, mining contributes to less than 1\% of the total land use-related biodiversity loss, which is dominated by agriculture. Our results provide transparency in sourcing more sustainable mining products and underline synergies in fostering renewables to meet local biodiversity and global climate targets.},

Prior research indicates that these norm-constrained institutions engage in negative screening and invest less in firms operating in `sin' industries. We examine whether social norms also motivate these institutions to engage in positive screening---where they invest more in firms with better corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance---and CSR-related activism---where they promote improvements in the CSR of existing investees. We find that firms with superior CSR performance have greater ownership by norm-constrained institutions, consistent with positive screening, and we use a natural experiment to establish causality. We also find that increases in the shareholdings of norm-constrained institutions are associated with subsequent improvements in CSR, consistent with activism. Further, we rule out an alternative explanation for our results where the positive screening and activism are `profit-driven' rather than driven by social pressure. Thus, our results suggest that the influence of social norms on stock markets is more pervasive than documented in the prior literature.},

Combining Input-Output (IO) and network theory, we define measures to identify both the sectors likely to trigger relevant capital stranding cascades and those most exposed to capital stranding risk. We show how, in a sample of ten European countries, mining is among the sectors with the highest external asset strand- ing multipliers. The sectors most affected by capital stranding triggered by decarbonisation include electricity and gas; coke and refined petroleum products; basic metals; and transporta- tion. From these sectors, stranding would frequently cascade down to chemicals; metal products; motor vehicles water and waste services; wholesale and retail trade; and public administration. Finally, we provide an estimate for the lower-bound amount of assets at risk of transition-related stranding, which is in the range of 0.6-8.2\% of the overall productive capital stock for our sample of countries, mainly concentrated in the electricity and gas sector, manufacturing, and mining. These results confirm the systemic relevance of transition-related risks on European societies.}

It is the essence of the ``just transition,'' the connective tissue that binds together climate goals with social outcomes centered around jobs. This policy note proposes the first iteration of a just transition policy framework built around three interrelated and mutually reinforcing pillars. These include: (i) a system for determining a hierarchy of priorities for activities, sectors, or groups that are to be compensated for the negative impacts they suffer from the transition to a low-carbon economy or supported because they contribute directly to a more equitable sharing of the costs and opportunities from the transition; (ii) a fiscal transfer mechanism to allocate public funds consistent with these priorities; and (iii) financial flows enablers, a set of instruments or policy interventions to facilitate private financial flows to activities or projects that are deemed to contribute to a more just transition. The assessment provides seven key takeaways for consideration by competent authorities to strengthen further the EU just transition policy framework going forward. These are: (i) narrowing the scope of the framework by focusing on social support and/or land restoration, while encouraging private sector funding for economic revitalization projects; (ii) enhancing data collection on social impact assessment to better understand the negative effects of climate transition initiatives and prevent ''social washing''; (iii) embedding just transition considerations in sustainability regulations by including relevant indicators and metrics; (iv) providing guidance on assessing just transition-related risks for financial firms in prioritized regions and sectors; (v) clarifying supervisory expectations for financial firms regarding just transition-related litigation and liability risk; (vi) encouraging the development of financial instruments for the just transition; and (vii) maximizing the role of multilateral development banks in de-risking just transition projects, especially in member countries with limited resources and capacity.},

Drawing on extensive qualitative research (interviews, participant observation, and two sets of survey data among actors relevant to these mineral supply chains), this article advances the notion of ``digital extraction'' to describe the collection, analysis, and instrumentalization of digital data generated under the banner of blockchain-based due diligence, chain of custody certifications, and various transparency mechanisms, situated alongside and in support of mineral extraction. The article mobilizes concepts from political geography and political ecology to argue that digital technologies of traceability in extractive processes potentially create new forms of control and exclusion or exacerbate existing social, political, and territorial dispossession through asymmetric relations of power and knowledge in mineral supply chains. Despite industry efforts to make mineral supply chains more sustainable by resorting to digital certification and traceability, the strategic uses of uncertainty, ignorance, and ambiguity undergirding blockchain-enabled traceability systems fail to challenge existing inequalities in resource use and access or fulfill the promise of transparency and accountability.},

We first present the theoretical links between asset pricing and climate-related risks and develop a theory of how climate risk drivers transmit costs to firms and lead to asset price changes. We then discuss studies looking at past climate-related events, which show that both climate physical impacts and transition dynamics can trigger a revaluation of financial assets through multiple direct and indirect channels. Finally, we review the emerging literature that uses forward-looking methodologies to estimate future climate-related asset price changes, which suggests that climate financial risks can indeed have significant implications on financial stability.},

Specifically, we investigate the lack of transparency of the extra-financial information communicated by asset managers. Using a unique international panel dataset of approximately 1500 equity mutual funds, we provide empirical evidence that some asset managers portray themselves as socially responsible yet do not make tangible investment decisions. Furthermore, our results indicate that the financial performance of mutual funds is not related to asset managers' signals but should be evaluated relatively using extra-financial ratings. In summary, our findings advocate for a unified regulation framework that constrains asset managers' communication.},

  abstract = {The transition to renewable energies will intensify the global competition for land. Nevertheless, most analyses to date have concluded that land will not pose significant constraints on this transition. Here, we estimate the land-use requirements to supply all currently consumed electricity and final energy with domestic solar energy for 40 countries considering two key issues that are usually not taken into account: (1) the need to cope with the variability of the solar resource, and (2) the real land occupation of solar technologies. We focus on solar since it has the highest power density and biophysical potential among renewables. The exercise performed shows that for many advanced capitalist economies the land requirements to cover their current electricity consumption would be substantial, the situation being especially challenging for those located in northern latitudes with high population densities and high electricity consumption per capita. Assessing the implications in terms of land availability (i.e., land not already used for human activities), the list of vulnerable countries enlarges substantially (the EU-27 requiring around 50\% of its available land), few advanced capitalist economies requiring low shares of the estimated available land. Replication of the exercise to explore the land-use requirements associated with a transition to a 100\% solar powered economy indicates this transition may be physically unfeasible for countries such as Japan and most of the EU-27 member states. Their vulnerability is aggravated when accounting for the electricity and final energy footprint, i.e., the net embodied energy in international trade. If current dynamics continue, emerging countries such as India might reach a similar situation in the future. Overall, our results indicate that the transition to renewable energies maintaining the current levels of energy consumption has the potential to create new vulnerabilities and/or reinforce existing ones in terms of energy and food security and biodiversity conservation.},

To that purpose, we use an original database provided by Covalence EthicalQuote. Our empirical analysis is based on about 33,000 ESG news (positive or negative), targeting one hundred listed companies over the period 2002--2010. On average, firms facing negative events experience a drop in their market value of 0.1\%, whereas companies gain nothing on average from positive announcements. We find also that market participants are responsive to the media, but they do not react to firms' press releases or to NGOs' disclosures. Moreover, our results indicate that sector's reputation mitigates the loss (the goodwill hypothesis) and that cultural proximity and lexical contents of ESG disclosures play a significant role in the magnitude of the impact.},

This paper demonstrates, through a series of simulations, that the nature of DFIs' operations creates systematic biases in how a range of estimators assess additionality.

However, around \$7.2 trillion of total enterprise value remains exposed to unmanaged biodiversity risk. Companies in sectors with material impacts on biodiversity tend to have high levels of response, but there is poorer responsiveness to material biodiversity dependency risks.

  author = {{Castillo-apraiz}, Julen},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Sustainable and responsible investing (SRI) is a strategy that seeks to combine both financial return and social good. The need to create and preserve SRI represents a key argument in investment decision-making, which leads other firms and investors to make strategic decisions beyond financial logic, based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Within this framework, this paper aims to further clarify the understanding of potentially profitable strategies for firms during a global crisis such as a pandemic. Both primary and secondary data were gathered, and descriptive analyses were conducted. In Spain, several IBEX-35 companies announced donations amid the COVID-19 crisis. First, companies were classified into two groups based on donations made. For this, we searched for ESG online news. Then, profitability records amongst companies were identified and compared. In the trading session after the announcements, we found 12 of the 35 companies that made donations had a higher performance index of more than 2 and 3 points over the companies that did not make donations. With a weekly perspective, the difference was 91 and 60 basis points, respectively. These results suggest that in times of upheaval, investors base their strategy on ESG factors, contributing to the emerging literature on individual motives of SRI. Second, by conducting a survey and collecting data from 575 Spanish citizens, we conclude that after this crisis, people's perceptions towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) will change, affecting consumption preferences in those companies that exhibited socially irresponsible or unsupportive behaviour. Hence, the reputation of firms, their social image, and social trust will play an important role in the near future.},

  abstract = {The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a quantitative viewpoint, that Earth's sixth mass extinction is more severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinctions. Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is extremely high-even in "species of low concern." In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32\% (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have lost 30\% or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40\% of the species have experienced severe population declines ({$>$}80\% range shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We describe this as a "biological annihilation" to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event.},

In our not-yet-low carbon world, investors face a trade-off between minimizing their exposure to climate risks and maximizing the benefits of portfolio diversification. This paper investigates how investors and financial intermediaries navigate this trade-off. After the release of Morningstar's novel carbon risk metrics in April 2018, mutual funds labeled as ``low carbon'' experienced a significant increase in investor demand, especially those with high risk-adjusted returns. Fund managers actively reduced their exposure to firms with high carbon risk scores, especially stocks with returns that correlated more with the funds' portfolios and were thus less useful for diversification. These findings shed light on whether and how climate-related information can re-orient capital flows in a low carbon direction.},

This debate has now taken root in Cambridge, England, where the ancient University of Cambridge confronts great pressure from students and staff members to respond to the threat of climate breakdown. Having already received two reports on its approach to responsible investment, the university appointed a new chief investment officer (CIO) who, alongside the Cambridge University Endowment Fund (CUEF) Trustee and the wider university community, needs to consider the question of whether to divest from, or to engage with, fossil fuel firms. What would be the financial effects of each choice, and what would be the outcome in terms of environmental impact? This case study describes the background and the research behind the debate. The new CIO and her colleague, the chief financial officer, reflect on both sides of this debate as they consider the position the university should adopt. In contrast with other journal articles, this one does not propose solutions.

  abstract = {The promise of co-production to address complex sustainability challenges is compelling. Yet, co-production, the collaborative weaving of research and practice, encompasses diverse aims, terminologies and practices, with poor clarity over their implications. To explore this diversity, we systematically mapped differences in how 32 initiatives from 6 continents co-produce diverse outcomes for the sustainable development of ecosystems at local to global scales. We found variation in their purpose for utilizing co-production, understanding of power, approach to politics and pathways to impact. A cluster analysis identified six modes of co-production: (1) researching solutions; (2) empowering voices; (3) brokering power; (4) reframing power; (5) navigating differences and (6) reframing agency. No mode is ideal; each holds unique potential to achieve particular outcomes, but also poses unique challenges and risks. Our analysis provides a heuristic tool for researchers and societal actors to critically explore this diversity and effectively navigate trade-offs when co-producing sustainability.},

Today, openness to alternative ideas and embracing innovative approaches in nursing education are encouraged in order to meet students' learning interests and needs, and to address ever-changing healthcare requests. Problem-based learning has been widely adopted in nursing education, with various positive effects on students' learning, such as motivated learning, team work, problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Role-plays have been demonstrated as an effective learning strategy that includes an active and experiential feature that facilitates students' autonomy in their health-related learning. However, there is a lack of discussion of whether and how role-play can be used in problem-based learning (PBL). This paper shows the development of a classroom-based innovation using role-play in the PBL class for higher diploma year-one nurse students (a total of 20 students, five per group). This paper consists of five sections: a) the literature on PBL and nurse education, and role-plays as the innovation; b) the PBL case scenario with the illustration of the two role-play scripts, c) student evaluation on role-play in the PBL class; d) discussions on both achievements and limitations of this innovation, and e) the conclusion. It is hoped that this paper will be an example to other nurse educators who are keen on exploring interactive and student-driven learning and teaching strategies in the PBL class.},

We find that oTree and SoPHIE rank highest across criteria, but Veconlab and classEx might be suitable for those with a dominant need for a large library of ready-made experiments. We find a portability gap: no presently available software allows portability of experiments across platforms because of technical complexity and the challenging coordination needs of experimental economists. As a result, experiments may be replicated only on the same platform or with the same software, but general replicability is slow and costly. This constrains the development of experimental economics as a replicable science.},

To that end, the report starts by providing scientific evidence on biodiversity loss and the interactions (impacts and dependencies) with human societies. It goes on to investigate the risks that biodiversity loss poses to human societies and then examines how re/insurers are exposed to those risks, how they affect biodiversity themselves and what opportunities exist for them to align their agenda with biodiversity challenges.

Faced with the climate catastrophe of the Anthropocene, theorists and policymakers are increasingly turning to 'sustainable', 'creative' and 'bottom-up' imaginaries of governance. The book brings together cutting-edge insights from leading geographers, international relations scholars and philosophers to explore how the concepts of resilience and the Anthropocene challenge and transform prevailing understandings of Earth, space, time and knowledge, and how these transformations reshape governance, ethics and critique today. This book examines how the Anthropocene calls into question established categories through which modern societies have tended to make sense of the world and engage in critical reflection and analysis. It also considers how resilience approaches attempt to re-stabilize these categories - and the ethical and political effects that result from these resilience-based efforts. Offering innovative insights into the problem of how environmental change is known and governed in the Anthropocene, this book will be of interest to students in fields such as geography, international relations, anthropology, science and technology studies, sociology, and the environmental humanities"--},

Many companies use life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate their sustainability, yet commonly-used LCA methodologies lack the spatial resolution and predictive ecological information to reveal key impacts on climate, water and biodiversity. We present advances for LCA that integrate spatially explicit modelling of land change and ecosystem services in a Land-Use Change Improved (LUCI)-LCA. Comparing increased demand for bioplastics derived from two alternative feedstock-location scenarios for maize and sugarcane, we find that the LUCI-LCA approach yields results opposite to those of standard LCA for greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and of different magnitudes for soil erosion and biodiversity. This approach highlights the importance of including information about where and how land-use change and related impacts will occur in supply chain and innovation decisions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sustaining the organisms, ecosystems and processes that underpin human wellbeing is necessary to achieve sustainable development. Here we define critical natural assets as the natural and semi-natural ecosystems that provide 90\% of the total current magnitude of 14 types of nature's contributions to people (NCP), and we map the global locations of these critical natural assets at 2\,km resolution. Critical natural assets for maintaining local-scale NCP (12 of the 14 NCP) account for 30\% of total global land area and 24\% of national territorial waters, while 44\% of land area is required to also maintain two global-scale NCP (carbon storage and moisture recycling). These areas overlap substantially with cultural diversity (areas containing 96\% of global languages) and biodiversity (covering area requirements for 73\% of birds and 66\% of mammals). At least 87\% of the world's population live in the areas benefitting from critical natural assets for local-scale NCP, while only 16\% live on the lands containing these assets. Many of the NCP mapped here are left out of international agreements focused on conserving species or mitigating climate change, yet this analysis shows that explicitly prioritizing critical natural assets and the NCP they provide could simultaneously advance development, climate and conservation goals.},

  abstract = {Theoretical understanding of deep learning is one of the most important tasks facing the statistics and machine learning communities. While deep neural networks (DNNs) originated as engineering methods and models of biological networks in neuroscience and psychology, they have quickly become a centerpiece of the machine learning toolbox. Unfortunately, DNN adoption powered by recent successes combined with the open-source nature of the machine learning community, has outpaced our theoretical understanding. We cannot reliably identify when and why DNNs will make mistakes. In some applications like text translation these mistakes may be comical and provide for fun fodder in research talks, a single error can be very costly in tasks like medical imaging. As we utilize DNNs in increasingly sensitive applications, a better understanding of their properties is thus imperative. Recent advances in DNN theory are numerous and include many different sources of intuition, such as learning theory, sparse signal analysis, physics, chemistry, and psychology. An interesting pattern begins to emerge in the breadth of possible interpretations. The seemingly limitless approaches are mostly constrained by the lens with which the mathematical operations are viewed. Ultimately, the interpretation of DNNs appears to mimic a type of Rorschach test --- a psychological test wherein subjects interpret a series of seemingly ambiguous ink-blots. Validation for DNN theory requires a convergence of the literature. We must distinguish between universal results that are invariant to the analysis perspective and those that are specific to a particular network configuration. Simultaneously we must deal with the fact that many standard statistical tools for quantifying generalization or empirically assessing important network features are difficult to apply to DNNs.},

  abstract = {The consumption of most metals continues to rise following ever-increasing population growth, affluence and technological development. Sustainability considerations urge greater resource efficiency and retention of metals in the economy. We model the fate of a yearly cohort of 61 extracted metals over time and identify where losses are expected to occur through a life-cycle lens. We find that ferrous metals have the longest lifetimes, with 150 years on average, followed by precious, non-ferrous and specialty metals with 61, 50 and 12 years on average, respectively. Production losses are the largest for 15 of the studied metals whereas use losses are the largest for barium, mercury and strontium. Losses to waste management and recycling are the largest for 43 metals, suggesting the need to improve design for better sorting and recycling and to ensure longer-lasting products, in combination with improving waste-management practices. Compared with the United Nations Environmental Programme's recycling statistics, our results show the importance of taking a life-cycle perspective to estimate losses of metals to develop effective circular economy strategies. We provide the dataset and model used in a machine-readable format to allow further research on metal cycles.},

In one of the first studies to assess these ratings, we examine how well the most widely used ratings - those of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini Research \& Analytics (KLD) - provide transparency about past and likely future environmental performance. We find KLD "concern" ratings to be fairly good summaries of past environmental performance. In addition, firms with more KLD concerns have slightly, but statistically significantly, more pollution and regulatory compliance violations in later years. KLD environmental strengths, in contrast, do not accurately predict pollution levels or compliance violations. Moreover, we find evidence that KLD's ratings are not optimally using publicly available data. We discuss the implications of our findings for advocates and skeptics of corporate social responsibility as well as for studies that relate social responsibility ratings to financial performance. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We find that managers competed for inclusion in the index by significantly increasing return on equity (ROE), and they did so at least in part due to their reputational or status concerns. The ROE increase was predominantly driven by improvements in margins, which were in turn partially driven by cutting research and development (R\&D) intensity. Our findings suggest that indexes can affect managerial behavior through reputational or status incentives.},

Most developing and emerging economies face an urgent need to scale up sustainable finance for low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure.

This approach would not only provide investors of different sizes the opportunity to purchase local-currency assets and issuers such as municipalities to raise funds for sustainable infrastructure investment. It would also facilitate project management once the project is operational, e.g. through metering and billing, and create full transparency across the life cycle of the investment, reducing problems with mis-use of funds.},

The efficiency of conservation investments, including payments for ecosystem services (PES), has been found to be affected by biological, political, economic, demographic, and social factors, but little is known about the effects of social norms at the neighborhood level. As a first attempt to quantify the effects of social norms, we studied the effects of a series of possible factors on people's intentions of maintaining forest on their Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) land plots if the program ends. GTGP is one of the world's largest PES programs and plays an important role in global conservation efforts. Our study was conducted in China's Wolong Nature Reserve, home to the world-famous endangered giant pandas and {$>$}4,500 farmers. We found that, in addition to conservation payment amounts and program duration, social norms at the neighborhood level had significant impacts on program re-enrollment, suggesting that social norms can be used to leverage participation to enhance the sustainability of conservation benefits from PES programs. Moreover, our results demonstrate that economic and demographic trends also have profound implications for sustainable conservation. Thus, social norms should be incorporated with economic and demographic trends for efficient conservation investments.},

  abstract = {Conservation investments are increasingly being implemented through payments for ecosystem services (PES) for the protection and restoration of ecosystem services around the world. Previous studies suggested that social norms have substantial impacts on environmental behaviors of humans, including enrollment of PES programs. However, it is still not well understood how social norms are affected by the design of PES programs and how the evolution of social norms may affect the efficiency of conservation investments. In this paper, we developed an agent-based simulation model to demonstrate the evolution and impacts of social norms on the enrollment of agricultural land in a PES program. We applied the model to land plots that have been enrolled in China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) to examine reenrollment in an alternative payment program when the current payments ceased. The study was conducted in Wolong Nature Reserve where several thousand plant and animal species, including giant pandas, may benefit from the reenrollment. We found that over 15\% more GTGP land can be reenrolled at the same payment if social norms were leveraged by allowing more than 10 rounds of interactions among landholders regarding their reenrollment decisions. With only three rounds of interactions, an additional 7.5\% GTGP land was reenrolled at the same payment due to the effects of social norms. In addition, the effects of social norms were largest at intermediate payments and were smaller at much higher or much smaller payments. Even in circumstances where frequent interactions among landholders about their enrollment decisions are not feasible, policy arrangements that divide households into multiple waves for sequential enrollment can enroll over 11\% more land at a given payment level. The approach presented in this paper can be used to improve the efficiency of existing PES programs and many other conservation investments worldwide. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We used long-term global satellite-based land cover records to calibrate key Demeter parameters. The results identified the optimal parameter values and showed that the parameterization substantially improved the model's performance. The parameters of intensification ratio and selection threshold were the most sensitive and needed to be carefully tuned, especially for regional applications. Further, small parameter uncertainties after calibration can be inflated when propagated into future scenarios, suggesting that users should consider the parameterization equifinality to better account for the uncertainties in Demeter-downscaled products. Our study provides a key reference for Demeter users and ultimately contributes to reducing the uncertainties in Earth system model simulations.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of implementing green investments within organizations and to identify the drivers that influence decisions for the implementation of green investments. In order to achieve this, two types of analyses were used: bibliometric analysis and systematic analysis, researching the representative studies in the field. The search was carried out for the period 1990-2020, and the analyzed sample comprised 444 articles. Following the application of the two methods of analysis, the results show that in the last 6 years the interest of companies in green investments has increased significantly, organizations being concerned with the efficient use of resources and environmental issues. This research highlights the internal and external drivers over which companies have a higher or lower control, as the case may be, in order to involve in green investments. The article offers new pathways for future research on this matter. Therefore, future research may develop a detailed description of the identified drivers for green investment. In addition, further research can calculate the level of the drivers' impact on green investment and can identify that certain drivers should be more attentively treated. Moreover, subsequent works in this field can continue to identify new drivers or new ways of promoting the already identified drivers in the present research. Consequently, green investment could produce positive effects related to the reduction of pollution and global warming.},

To understand how investment information spreads via person-to-person conversations, I observe paired investors in a well-controlled experiment. While self-enhancement bias suggests that investors may be more likely to discuss their performance when they have positive returns, I find the reverse: in conversations, investors with positive returns appear less likely to talk about their investment outcome. Experimental transcripts highlight conversational norms as a key mechanism. For example, though sharing information about one's positive performance may feel good, it may have a negative effect on the listener, and making one's counterpart feel bad is often inappropriate. Thus, in the experiment, investors with positive returns are reluctant to discuss their performance if they do not know their counterpart's return, or if they learn it is negative. These results show that conversational norms shape the diffusion of investment information. 2},

But 2012 is also the tenth anniversary of the present biannual Study whose 5th edition Eurosif is pleased to present, together with the national SIFs who were instrumental in contributing to the research. Over these years, the SRI industry has witnessed significant changes and our European Sustainable and Responsible Investment Study has constantly evolved to reflect these adjustments and stay current with the industry developments. While finding a consensus around a single definition of SRI across Europe remains challenging, this Study aims to further inspire the debate and help the general public, as well as industry practitioners, policy makers and other commentators to gain insight to an increasingly sophisticated market. This is why this 5th European SRI Study brings with it a few changes as it, for instance, focuses on trends affecting individual responsible investment strategies and includes for the first time a brief review of the European impact investing market.},

  abstract = {We experimentally investigate how managers' decisions to invest discretionary resources in the company's corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are affected by whether the investment decision is denominated in financial or nonfinancial measures (i.e., the measurement basis used for decision making). We posit that nonfinancial measures bring attention to the society-serving nature of CSR investments, thus activating the pro-CSR social norms of the company and managers' personal CSR norms. Norm activation, in turn, influences managers' investment decisions to the extent that social norms are congruent with personal norms. As predicted, we find that the level of CSR investment is higher under a nonfinancial measurement basis than under a financial measurement basis, but only when the manager is personally supportive of CSR. Supplemental analysis indicates that CSR-supportive managers continue to invest more under a combined financial/nonfinancial measurement basis than under a financial measurement basis only. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {This article argues that comparability in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) exchange traded funds (ETFs) is a much greater problem than greenwashing. Rising demand for sustainable investment products in recent years has been met with an explosion in ESG ETF varieties, and numerous ESG-themed funds have captured massive capital inflows. There is little evidence, however, that deceptive "greenwashing" is widespread in ETFs. ETF issuers face significant reputational costs from such behavior, and there are effectively no consumer switching costs for hyper-liquid, easily accessible ETFs. While non-deceptive practices of asset-managers are observable in the zero-sum, highly competitive, asset management game of capturing new ESG-directed capital flows, the subjectivity that ETF issuers use to integrate ESG considerations into the composition of underlying ETF holdings is so disparate that investors face tremendous information acquisition and synthesis costs, and difficulty comparing products. This dilemma grows as product choice expands. ESG ETFs also create unique issuer and commercial index provider conflicts. An investor focused regulatory framework for ESG ETFs would aid comparability, standardization, and consistent product marketing presentation. To this end, this article builds on the author's prior work on comparative complexity in ETFs by advancing three immediate measures to improve comparability and facilitate more efficient capital allocation in ESG ETF varieties: first, require justification of a fund's usage of ESG terminology in its name through specific ETF disclosures; second, standardize ESG measurement metrics; and third, mandate uniform information presentation layouts on ETF issuer websites.},

  abstract = {The Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework represents a significant advance in specifying the ecological constraints on human development. However, to enable decision-makers in business and public policy to respect these constraints in strategic planning, the PB framework needs to be developed to generate practical tools. With this objective in mind, we analyse the recent literature and highlight three major scientific and technical challenges in operationalizing the PB approach in decision-making: first, identification of thresholds or boundaries with associated metrics for different geographical scales; second, the need to frame approaches to allocate fair shares in the `safe operating space' bounded by the PBs across the value chain and; third, the need for international bodies to co-ordinate the implementation of the measures needed to respect the Planetary Boundaries. For the first two of these challenges, we consider how they might be addressed for four PBs: climate change, freshwater use, biosphere integrity and chemical pollution and other novel entities. Four key opportunities are identified: (1) development of a common system of metrics that can be applied consistently at and across different scales; (2) setting `distance from boundary' measures that can be applied at different scales; (3) development of global, preferably open-source, databases and models; and (4) advancing understanding of the interactions between the different PBs. Addressing the scientific and technical challenges in operationalizing the planetary boundaries needs be complemented with progress in addressing the equity and ethical issues in allocating the safe operating space between companies and sectors.},

  abstract = {As the complexity of transnational corporations (TNCs) grew in the post-war period, their effective degree of disclosure diverged from what is standardly expected of single-country firms. Country-by-country reporting is the key proposal to reestablish appropriate TNC disclosure, and ultimately TNC accountability -- and as such, has been consistently resisted by many TNCs, professional services firms and some key headquarters countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. This paper charts two main waves of pressure for progress. The first, most visible from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, reflects the claims of the New International Economic Order and the rise of the G77 group of countries, while the second saw international civil society take a leading role. The current phase sees these two impulses combine and may finally deliver meaningful progress. The paper addresses both the political underpinnings and the developing technical component to the claims for deeper TNC disclosure, ultimately shaped into the pursuit of an international standard for public, country-by-country reporting -- and the resistance to it. The paper also provides illustrative results based on the existing country-by-country reporting data for banks. It concludes with a discussion of the prospects for country-by-country reporting.},

This chapter examines the proposition of a role-play  dealing with a complex, global issue to engage students in developing competences that are commensurate with the transdisciplinary and dialogical  context of a society in post-normal conditions. In the fi nal part, an illustration of a recent experience of role-playing in a secondary school classroom will focus on the process and outcomes of students' engagement in  the role-play. This chapter has many purposes: to establish the theoretical  foundations for using role-play in a framework of sustainability; to illustrate how a role-play can be constructed and used for this purpose and to  exemplify the learning processes that are enacted. This will form the basis  for a refl ection on the changing nature of knowledge production in the  classroom and the wider implications that this can have for education and  research at the interface with science and society.},

  abstract = {Climate change mitigation would benefit from Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) in developing countries. The REDD mechanism, still in discussion, would be in charge of distilling the right incentives and promoting the right policies for fostering forest conservation. The estimation of reduced emissions induced by the mechanism has been raised as an issue, either for issuing the proper amount of carbon credits or for providing appropriate compensations of foregone revenues and other costs to host countries. This estimation would be based on the gap between observed deforestation and a counterfactual value. Although any prediction of deforestation rates (i.e. business-as-usual scenarios) is challenging, and any negotiated target is subject to obvious political influence, these two ways have been prioritirized so far to determine the counterfactual value. In other words proposals focused on a results-based approach, the relevance of which is questionable because estimations of avoided deforestation are hardly reliable. With this approach, issuance of carbon credits and distribution of financial compensations could threaten respectively environmental integrity of the scheme and equity outcomes. Rather than considering overall deforestation (predicted and observed), we argue that a REDD mechanism would gain from linking distribution of carbon finance to real efforts (opposed to ``results'') that developing countries implement for slowing deforestation rates. This would provide strong incentives to design and enforce suitable policies and measures. The methodology we present to measure these efforts (labeled Compensated Successful Efforts) is based on the rationale that overall deforestation is partly due to structural factors, and to domestic policies and measures. This typology differs from others presented in the literature such as proximate/underlying causes, or economic/institutional factors. Using an econometric model, our approach estimates efforts that are (i) independent of structural factors (economic development, population, initial forest area, agricultural export prices), (ii) estimated ex post at the end of the crediting period, and (iii) relative to other countries. In order to illustrate the methodology we apply the model to a panel of 48 countries (Asia, Latin America, Africa) and four periods between 1970 and 2005. We conclude on the feasibility to estimate avoided deforestation using the Compensated Successful Efforts approach. In addition to being conservative from an environmental perspective, this approach tends to guarantee fairness by accounting for dramatic changes during the commitment period. Last, such estimations of avoided deforestation could provide guidance for decisions on further financing of national programs to curb deforestation, as it would help to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful policies.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Addressing the global extent of the current biodiversity crisis requires engaging with the existence of multiple equally legitimate values, but also with diverse ethical perspectives underpinning conceptions of right and wrong actions. However, western monist positions have mostly explicitly or implicitly directed conservation strategies by defining the space of legitimate arguments, overlooking solutions that do not fit neatly the chosen approaches. As ignoring diverse ethical positions leads to injustices and reduces the potential of conserving biodiversity, there is a need to recognise and navigate the ethical landscape. Ethical pluralism may provide opportunities to do so. However, the ethical underpinnings of pluralism have not been fully considered in biodiversity conservation. In this article, we elaborate the meaning, importance and limits of ethical pluralism while highlighting opportu\- nities and challenges that the position may entail in biodiversity conservation science and practice. We argue that ethical pluralism allows recognising not only the existence of incommensurable plural values, but also that moral conflicts should embrace intra and inter-cultural criticism and the legitimacy of agonism and dissent, as opposed to monistic and relativistic approaches. We conclude by discussing how grounding ethical pluralism in envi\- ronmental justice and environmental pragmatism may contribute to navigating the ethical landscape in biodi\- versity conservation. Particularly, we highlight opportunities to: i) promote (non-anthropocentrically understood) recognition and environmental justice in biodiversity conservation and, ii) move beyond theoretical debates seeking the single best ethical theory and focus on ethical diversity as a common source of possible solutions.},

  abstract = {There have been five Mass Extinction events in the history of Earth's biodiversity, all caused by dramatic but natural phenomena. It has been claimed that the Sixth Mass Extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a Sixth Mass Extinction. Often, they use the IUCN Red List to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the Red List is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the Sixth Mass Extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around AD 1500, possibly as many as 7.5--13\% (150,000--260,000) of all 2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04\%) on the Red List. We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non-marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the Earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the Earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a Sixth Mass Extinction.},

  abstract = {The consumption of materials and products is one of the drivers of biodiversity loss, which in turn affects ecosystem functioning and has socio-economic consequences worldwide. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a reference methodology for appraising the environmental impacts of products along their value chains. Currently, a generally accepted life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) framework for assessing biodiversity impacts is lacking. The existing LCIA models present weaknesses in terms of the impact drivers considered, geographical coverage, as well as the indicators and metrics adopted. Sound ecological indicators and metrics need to be integrated in order to better assess the impacts of value chains on biodiversity on a global, regional, and local scale. This review analyses studies which, using a life cycle perspective, assess the impacts of products' and services' value chains on biodiversity. We identify and discuss promising synergies between the studies which look beyond the life cycle context, and apply other biodiversity metrics. Our results highlight that the existing metrics of biodiversity impact assessment in LCA are poor at capturing the complexities of biodiversity. There are operational models at the midpoint level that expand on the assessed dimensions of biodiversity (e.g., ecosystem structure), and the drivers of biodiversity loss (e.g., assessment of species exploitation), but efforts are required to fully include these models in the LCA framework. In the business domain, many initiatives are developing frameworks to assess impacts on biodiversity. Many approaches make use of LCIA methods and input-output databases. However, these are generally coupled with other biodiversity metrics. This shows that the current LCA framework is not yet sufficient to support decision-making based on different sets of biodiversity indicators. Ecosystem accounting may provide important ecological information for both the inventory and the impact assessment stages of LCA, helping to disentangle the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services. Looking beyond the LCA domain can lead us to new ways of advancing the coverage of biodiversity impacts, in a way that increases the relevance of LCA across a wider range of areas. Future work should assess the indicators provided in various policy contexts.},

Some FIPs are industry-led, others are championed by NGOs. They range across many different fishery types, in both high- and low-income settings. Their diversity is notable, and their proliferation remarkable. This rapid growth suggests FIPs are becoming a key feature of the fisheries governance landscape globally. Based on a global sample of 107 FIPs, we systematically examined their reported actions, the actors involved, and their achievements in terms of policy and practice outputs. The most common actions were dialogues with policy stakeholders, data collection, and educational efforts directed at fishers. Common policy outputs included development of management plans and/or a management body, and rules for limiting entry and increasing compliance. Practice related outputs were dominated by gear changes, and observer and traceability programs. Only crab and lobster FIPs engaged in sustained policy conversations as one of the most common actions. Shrimp and tuna fisheries report more engagement in testing and implementing changes to fishery practices. While supply chain actors are involved in all FIPs, retailers and 1st tier suppliers are relatively absent from FIP activities, and are primarily involved in rallying financial support or some policy engagement. Based on our analysis we discuss the opportunities and challenges FIPs will likely need to engage with to contribute to a global transition to more socially and environmentally sustainable fisheries. We outline key areas where further work is needed to understand how FIPs can improve their contribution to global fisheries governance in the future.},

  abstract = {Ocean activities are rapidly expanding as Blue Economy discussions gain traction, creating new potential synergies and conflicts between sectors. To better manage ocean sectors and their development, we need to understand how they interact and the respective outcomes of these interactions. To provide a first comprehensive picture of the situation, we review 3187 articles to map and analyze interactions between economically important ocean sectors and find 93 unique direct and 61 indirect interactions, often mediated via the ocean ecosystem. Analysis of interaction outcomes reveals that some sectors coexist synergistically (e.g. renewable energy, tourism), but many interactions are antagonistic, and negative effects on other sectors are often incurred via degradation of marine ecosystems. The analysis also shows that ocean ecosystems are fundamental for supporting many ocean sectors, yet 13 out of 14 ocean sectors have interactions resulting in unidirectional negative ecosystem impact. Fishing, drilling, and shipping are hubs in the network of ocean sector interactions, and are involved in many of the antagonistic interactions. Antagonistic interactions signal trade-offs between sectors. Qualitative analysis of the literature shows that these tradeoffs relate to the cumulative nature of many ecosystem impacts incurred by some sectors, and the differential power of ocean sectors to exert their rights or demands in the development of the ocean domain. There are also often time lags in how impacts manifest. The ocean governance landscape is not currently well-equipped to deal with the full range of trade-offs, and opportunities, likely to arise in the pursuit of a Blue Economy in a rapidly changing ocean context. Based on our analysis, we therefore propose a set principles that can begin to guide strategic decision-making, by identifying both tradeoffs and opportunities for sustainable and equitable development of ocean sectors.},

We then look at what the state-of-the-art climate and Earth System science has to offer investors interested in absolute environmental sustainability. Next, we discuss the risks associated with a blurring of concepts relating to sustainability and materiality, and examine and contrast conventional ESG rating procedures with new approaches informed by BD and AI to understand what this new generation of tools can offer investors interested in sustainability. We note a current misalignment between stated ambitions of investors, and the ability to deliver on stated goals through the use of current ESG metrics and ratings. We therefore finish with suggestions for how to better align these and how those interested in ESG can become more `sustainability savvy' consumers of such ratings.},

Based on a systematic literature review of 166 articles, we map and integrate the main elements of the SFI field and identify the most relevant avenues for further research. In this process, we provide a definition of SFI; identify the main players in the field; and describe their profiles, strategies, and outcomes. We also propose a framework for understanding the SFI field and a research agenda. This agenda organizes the main SFI research questions and suggests suitable approaches to address them. We conclude that SFI players have worked together to promote positive social and environmental impacts through their financial and investment activities. However, the under-theorization of the SFI concept, the traditional short-term nature of financial logic, and the lack of evidence on the SFI impacts on society and the environment are the greatest challenges facing the field.},

In response to these concerns, shareholders are increas-ingly focusing on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) cri-teria in selecting investments, and asset managers are responding by offering a growing number of ESG mutual funds. The flow of assets into ESG is one of the most dramatic trends in asset management. But are these funds giving investors what they promise? This question has at- tracted the attention of regulators, with the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) both taking steps to rein in ESG funds. The change in administration has created an opportunity to rethink these steps, but the rapid growth and evolution of the market mean regulators are acting without a clear picture of ESG investing. We fill this gap by offering the most complete empirical overview of ESG mu- tual funds to date. Combining comprehensive data on mutual funds with proprietary data from the several of the most significant ESG ratings firms, we provide a unique picture of the current ESG environment with an eye to inform-ing regulatory policy. We evaluate a number of criticisms of ESG funds made by academics and policymakers and find them lacking. We find that ESG funds offer their investors increased ESG exposure. They also vote their shares differ- ently from non-ESG funds and are more supportive of ESG principles. Our analysis shows that they do so without increasing costs or reducing returns. We conclude that ESG funds generally offer investors a differentiated and competitive investment product that is consistent with their labeling. In short, we see no reason to single out ESG funds for special regulation.},

Despite the overall effectiveness of feed-in tariffs, actual adoption rates have shown surprising regional differences, pointing to the presence of peer influence and regional spillover effects. For future diffusion of photovoltaics, understanding these social influences on the decision to adopt is key. Several studies have used revealed preference approaches to discern peer effects in PV adoption, proving their existence but leaving open questions about underlying psychological mechanisms. We close this gap by conducting a survey among potential PV adopters in one of the top three fastest-growing European solar markets and find that two types of social norms, descriptive and injunctive norms and their underlying interplay, play an important role in explaining PV adoption decision and diffusion patterns. Our findings have significant policy implications -- as an alternative to following the shotgun approach of uniform nationwide incentives, policymakers should consider inducing snowball effects by facilitating the creation of regional hot spots. Such programs, which may be supported through co-investments between federal and local authorities, would effectively complement existing policy approaches.},

We show that (i) carbon taxes reduce global warming but increase financial risks due to their adverse effects on the profitability of firms and credit availability; (ii) green subsidies and green public investment improve ecological efficiency, but their positive environmental impact is partially offset by their macroeconomic rebound effects; and (iii) a green fiscal policy mix derives better outcomes than isolated policies.

  abstract = {Background In order to stimulate reflection and continuous professional development, a model of critical friends evaluating each other was introduced in medical education. Objective To investigate whether the critical friend concept can serve as a pragmatic model for evaluation of medical teachers and as a fruitful tool for enhancing self-knowledge and professional development among medical educators. Methods Three pairs of critical friends were formed, consisting of experienced medical teachers (n = 6) at the Karolinska Institutet. Each teacher was assigned to give 1 lecture and 1 seminar in his or her specific research or clinical field. The critical friend evaluated the performance in class, acting as an observer using a pre-formed protocol. The evaluation was communicated to the teacher during a 45-minute session within 48 hours after the teaching session. Each of the 6 teachers was criticised and gave criticism within the pair configurance. The outcome of the process was evaluated by an experimenter, not participating in the process, who performed a semistructured interview with each of the 6 teachers. Results Each teacher had a different way of reflecting on teaching after the project than before and made changes in his or her way of teaching. We also noted that being a critical friend may be even more effective than having one. The majority of the feedback provided was positive and valuable. Conclusion To be and to have a critical friend is worth the extra workload. Therefore, the critical friend concept should be made part of regular teaching practice.},

These two problems are usually tackled separately in the policy agenda. A new breed of radical proposals have been advanced to manage a fair low-carbon transition. In this spirit, we develop a dynamic macrosimulation model to investigate the long-term effects of three scenarios: green growth, policies for social equity, and degrowth. The green growth scenario, based on technological progress and environmental policies, achieves a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of increasing income inequality and unemployment. The policies for social equity scenario adds direct labour market interventions that result in an environmental performance similar to green growth while improving social conditions at the cost of increasing public deficit. The degrowth scenario further adds a reduction in consumption and exports, and achieves a greater reduction in emissions and inequality with higher public deficit, despite the introduction of a wealth tax. We argue that new radical social policies can combine social prosperity and low-carbon emissions and are economically and politically feasible.},

  abstract = {Global biodiversity is in rapid decline and halting biodiversity loss is one of the most important challenges humanity must tackle now and in the immediate future. The five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss are climate change, pollution, land use, overexploitation of resources and the spread of invasive species, which result from indirect drivers such as unsustainable production and consumption. It is therefore of paramount importance that scientifically robust methods are developed to capture impacts on biodiversity from a value-chain perspective. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology allows to quantify the impact of products and organisations throughout their whole life cycle. In the LCA framework, several methods for biodiversity impact assessment have been developed. Building on previous reviews, this article aims to critically analyse methods and models for biodiversity impact assessment in LCA and beyond as comprehensively as possible, and to select those that may be most suitable for application in an LCA context. 64 methods were reviewed and 23 were selected for a detailed analysis based on availability of documentation, domain of application, geographical scope, potential to be used in LCA, and added value. The analysis addressed their goal and scope, data use and needs, and impact assessment characteristics, revealing strengths and weaknesses of the methods. There is currently no method that takes well into account at the same time the variety of pressures on biodiversity, ecosystems, taxonomic groups, essential biodiversity variables classes, and the fundamental aspects to consider in biodiversity impact assessments -- but for each of these five criteria, we show which methods perform best. For the future development of biodiversity impact assessment, it is required to improve the coverage of drivers of biodiversity loss, increase ecosystem and taxonomic coverage, include the assessment of ecosystem services, and develop robust indicators that allow for complementary analysis of more essential biodiversity aspects.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper will give an overview of LCA studies on lead metal production and use recently conducted by the International Lead Association. Methods: The lead industry, through the International Lead Association (ILA), has recently completed three life cycle studies to assess the environmental impact of lead metal production and two of the products that make up approximately 90~\% of the end uses of lead, namely lead-based batteries and architectural lead sheet. Results and discussion: Lead is one of the most recycled materials in widespread use and has the highest end-of-life recycling rate of all commonly used metals. This is a result of the physical chemical properties of the metal and product design, which makes lead-based products easily identifiable and economic to collect and recycle. For example, the end-of-life collection and recycling rates of lead automotive and industrial batteries and lead sheet in Europe are 99 and 95~\%, respectively, making them one of the few products that operate in a true closed loop. These high recycling rates, coupled with the fact that both lead-based batteries and architectural lead sheet are manufactured from recycled material, have a beneficial impact on the results of LCA studies, significantly lowering the overall environmental impact of these products. This means that environmental impacts associated with mining and smelting of lead ores are minimised and in some cases avoided completely. The lead battery LCA assesses not only the production and end of life but also the use phase of these products in vehicles. The study demonstrates that the technological capabilities of innovative advanced lead batteries used in start-stop vehicles significantly offset the environmental impact of their production. A considerable offset is realised through the savings achieved in global warming potential when lead-based batteries are installed in passenger vehicles with start-stop and micro-hybrid engine systems which have significantly lower fuel consumption than regular engines. Conclusions: ILA has undertaken LCAs which investigate the environmental impact associated with the European production of lead metal and the most significant manufactured lead products (lead-based batteries used in vehicles and architectural lead sheet for construction) to ensure up-to-date and robust data is publically and widely available.},

We apply the integrated assessment model MEDEAS-World to study four global transportation decarbonization strategies for 2050. The results show that a massive replacement of oil-fueled individual vehicles to electric ones alone cannot deliver GHG reductions consistent with climate stabilization and could result in the scarcity of some key minerals, such as lithium and magnesium. In addition, energy-economy feedbacks within an economic growth system create a rebound effect that counters the benefits of substitution. The only strategy that can achieve the objectives globally follows the Degrowth paradigm, combining a quick and radical shift to lighter electric vehicles and non-motorized modes with a drastic reduction in total transportation demand.},

Results are based on the second Shared Socio-Economic Pathway scenario, with additional climate policy assumptions based on the IMAGE integrated assessment framework, in combination with dynamic stock modelling and an elaborate review of material intensities. Results show a rapid growth in the demand for most materials in the electricity sector, as a consequence of increased electricity demand and a shift towards renewable electricity technologies, which have higher material intensities and drive the expansion of transmission infrastructure and electricity storage capacity. Under climate policy assumptions, the annual demand for most materials is expected to grow further towards 2050. For neodymium, the annual demand grows by a factor 4.4. Global demand for steel and aluminium in the electricity sector grows by a factor 2 in the baseline or 2.6 in the 2-degree climate policy scenario. We show that the combination of rapid growth of capital stocks and long lifetimes of technologies leads to a mismatch between annual demand and the availability of secondary materials within the electricity sector. This may limit the sector to accomplish circular material flows, especially under climate policy assumptions. We also highlight the potential for electric vehicles to curb some of the material demand related to electricity storage through adoption of vehicle-to-grid services.},

By building portfolios based on this controversy measure, the study shows that in Europe and the US, stocks that undergo severe controversies significantly underperform both their benchmarks and other portfolios consisting of stocks with low controversy or no controversy at all. The main reason for this result is that, in both cases, markets tend to react strongly to changes in controversy levels, penalizing stocks that experience ESG downgrades. These results make a clear case for the potential benefits of excluding stocks with high-controversy levels from investment universes. However, these findings are not confirmed for the Asia-Pacific region, where the portfolios consisting of highly controversial stocks outperform their benchmarks, although the number of such portfolios is lower compared to the number in Europe and the US.}

Much attention has been given to REDD+ projects in the literature, but the conditions under which they are likely to be effective are still not well known. In particular, the location bias concept states that projects are more likely to be implemented in remote areas, where development pressure is low, hence questioning the additionality of these projects. In this article, we examine this concept, assessing how the status of REDD+ project proponents and the project certification influence the choice of location and the project's additionality. Using a sample of six REDD+ projects in Brazil, we show that these two dimensions can impact location choice toward areas with higher or lower opportunity costs and that this choice can impact additionality. We also show that the selection of an area with low opportunity costs, which is frequently presented as a location bias, does not necessarily preclude additionality.},

  abstract = {Extracting, processing, and delivering energy requires energy itself, which reduces the net energy available to society and yields considerable socioeconomic implications. Yet, most mitigation pathways and transition models overlook net energy feedbacks, specifically related to the decline in the quality of fossil fuel deposits, as well as energy requirements of the energy transition. Here, we summarize our position across 8 key points that converge to form a prevailing understanding regarding EROI (Energy Return on Investment), identify areas of investigation for the Net Energy Analysis community, discuss the consequences of net energy in the context of the energy transition, and underline the issues of disregarding it. Particularly, we argue that reductions in net energy can hinder the transition if demand-side measures are not implemented and adopted to limit energy consumption. We also point out the risks posed for the energy transition in the Global South, which, while being the least responsible for climate change, may be amongst the most impacted by both the climate crisis and net energy contraction. Last, we present practical avenues to consider net energy in mitigation pathways and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), emphasizing the necessity of fostering collaborative efforts among our different research communities.},

This process is scheduled to take two years and is structured around four themes: marine genetic resources, area-based management tools (including marine protected areas), environmental impact assessments, and capacity building and marine technology transfer. This Perspective draws on the earth system governance literature and the authors' own experience of and views on the BBNJ process to provide insights and recommendations for the ongoing negotiations. It highlights three areas of concern: (i) the politicization of science and coping with scientific uncertainty, (ii) institutional fragmentation; and (iii) the need for a new agreement to respond to the complex set of multiple, multilevel, and systemic threats to marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.},

  abstract = {The World Economic Forum has identified biodiversity loss as an increasingly significant and impactful risk facing business. However, businesses themselves can negatively impact on biodiversity. Recognizing this, a number of companies have developed their own biodiversity commitments, including those to achieve a no net loss (NNL) or net positive impact (NPI) on biodiversity by balancing or outweighing any negative impacts through mitigation activities. We reviewed corporate-level NNL and NPI commitments over the last two decades to establish the extent of their adoption, retraction, and scientific foundation. Between 2001 and 2016, 66 companies had made NNL/NPI environmental commitments. Thirty three of these 66 companies made specific biodiversity commitments. The numbers of companies making commitments increased in that period. However, some commitments were retracted, or their status became unclear, leaving only 18 companies with active NNL/NPI biodiversity commitments in 2016. Added to this, many of the commitments are lacking science-based criteria that would allow more transparent and systematic assessment of corporate activities. Thus, although commitments are being made, they may not be delivering as intended. To secure real biodiversity gains, we recommend advancing methods to assess biodiversity risks to businesses, and using science-based criteria to deepen corporate commitments and actions. Concerted effort from all sectors is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and the ``biodiversity policy super-year'' of 2020 is the perfect moment for business to deliver through well-framed and implemented commitments to biodiversity NPI.},

This paper analyzes CSR activity using quasi-experimental variation created by Section 135 of India's Companies Act of 2013, which requires (on a ``comply-or-explain'' basis) that firms satisfying specific size or profit thresholds spend a minimum of 2\% of their net profit on CSR. We examine effects on CSR spending and related outcomes, as well as exploring broader theoretical implications. Our analysis uses financial statement data on Indian firms from the Prowess database, along with hand-collected data from firms' disclosures of CSR activity. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find significant increases in CSR activity among firms affected by Section 135, especially along the extensive margin (i.e. in the fraction of firms engaging in CSR spending). The fraction of firms subject to Section 135 that engage in advertising expenditures declines, consistent with substitution between advertising and CSR. For a subset of large firms, we hand-collect comprehensive CSR data and find that while firms initially spending less than 2\% increased their CSR activity, large firms initially spending more than 2\% reduced their CSR expenditures after Section 135 came into effect. We explore various explanations for this presumably unintended consequence of Section 135, and also seek to derive some wider implications of this analysis for understanding the role of CSR.},

Their price is set in private agreements following unofficial market practices which, along with the fact of the wide variety of concentrates layouts traded worldwide, make problematic for any market participant to have a clear price reference for a specific concentrate. This paper presents a copper concentrates benchmark price model which provides suitable short-term price estimations based on metals and discounts forecasts, as well as on copper, gold and silver spot and future prices data from the LME and COMEX. The model, which redeems considerably low forecast error values for the short-term concentrate prices, constitutes a useful and applicable tool for miners, traders and smelters to set a benchmark price level for their copper concentrate transactions, also helping them optimize their operations, as well as estimate their immediate liquidity needs or their actual necessity to hedge the price risks associated to their concentrate trading. In addition, different concentrates layouts have been analyzed to test the model's behavior with the most common specification and blends of copper concentrates demanded by the market, as well as to portray the model's forecasting capacity and its ability to convey information on the future relevance of the different components of pricing in the most frequent timeframe in which copper concentrate trading takes place.},

  abstract = {IAMs are usually divided into two categories: policy optimization IAMs and policy evaluation IAMs. Policy optimization IAMs search for the optimal policy. They can be split into three principal types: (i) Cost/benefit models which try to balance the costs and the benefits of climate policies, (ii) Target based models which simulate the effect of an efficient level of carbon abatement in the world economy, (3) Uncertainty based models which deal with decision making under conditions of uncertainty (Manne, Richels, 1992; Nordhaus, 1994). Many policy optimization models start with a market economy in which the regulatory instrument is a tax and then convert the model to an equivalent problem which finds the optimal emissions. Such models maximize the weighted sum of utilities where the weights are adjusted until individual budgets balance (which is equivalent to a Pareto Optimum (second welfare theorem)), or start with optimal emissions and convert the results into a tax. So optimization models are standardized and provide a description of the world, given the assumptions of the equivalence theorems. Policy evaluation IAMs are well-known as simulation models. They include deterministic projection models in which each input and output takes a single value, and stochastic projection models in which at least some inputs and outputs take a range of values. Policy evaluation models take actions by agents and governments as given, provided by policy proposals, assumption, observation and expert opinion. In this chapter, we propose to review 6 IAMs (World 3, DICE, IMAGE, MESSAGE, GEM-E3 and REMIND) to understand how these models are able to integrate Energy, Climate and Economics. We will resume their main results in a table to present goals, structure, policy evaluation, policy optimization, and dynamics associated with the models. We will identify the future challenges for research design and policy decisions.},

Five bituminous coal strip mines were used as case studies. The study assessed the life cycle water use, land use, energy use, abiotic resource depletion, and climate change impacts. Methods The study employed the general principles of the ISO 14040-49 series LCA standards, modifying them where necessary. The functional unit was defined as "one tonne of processed coal at the mine gate." The relative mass-energy-economic value method, with some modification, was used to scope the product system. Data were obtained from environmental impact statements, coal mining permit applications, government reports, and published literature. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) included classification and characterization but no normalization, grouping, or weighting, to avoid ambiguity. In this work, mid-point characterization models were preferred over damage-oriented (end-point) characterization models because of their high levels of uncertainties. The LCIA also included sensitivity analysis. Results and discussion For the studied mines, life cycle potential water use impact is 178 l/tonne of processed coal at the mine gate. The potential land use, energy use, abiotic resource depletion, and climate change impacts range from 3 to 10 m2 year/tonne, 97 to 181 MJ/tonne, 7.8 to 9.4 kg Sb-eq./tonne, and 38 to 92 kg CO2-eq./tonne, respectively. Land use impacts depend mainly on land for coal extraction activities and the climatic conditions of a region, which affects the vegetation recovery rate, following reclamation. Economies of scale significantly influence land use, energy use, abiotic resource depletion, and climate change impacts. Geology, which determines stripping ratio, coal quality, and coalbed methane, affects land use, climate change, and energy use impacts, particularly energy for overburden removal, reclamation, and beneficiation. Conclusions The data show that large-scale mining operations have lower life cycle impacts due to economies of scale, which results in lower energy use. Also, land use impacts, measured by land occupation, are affected by geologic conditions. This study provides insight into sources of variability in life cycle impacts of coal mining.

  abstract = {Projected increases in population, income and consumption rates are expected to lead to rising pressure on the land system. Ambitions to limit global warming to 2\,{$^\circ$}C or even 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C could also lead to additional pressures from land-based mitigation measures such as bioenergy production and afforestation. To investigate these dynamics, this paper describes five elaborations of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model framework to produce regional and gridded scenarios up to the year 2100. Additionally, land-based climate change mitigation is modelled aiming for long-term mitigation targets including 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C. Results show diverging global trends in agricultural land in the baseline scenarios ranging from an expansion of nearly 826\,Mha in SSP3 to a decrease of more than 305\,Mha in SSP1 for the period 2010--2050. Key drivers are population growth, changes in food consumption, and agricultural efficiency. The largest changes take place in Sub-Saharan Africa in SSP3 and SSP4, predominantly due to high population growth. With low increases in agricultural efficiency this leads to expansion of agricultural land and reduced food security. Land use also plays a crucial role in ambitious mitigation scenarios. First, agricultural emissions could form a substantial component of emissions that cannot be fully mitigated. Second, bioenergy and reforestation are crucial to create net negative emissions reducing emissions in SSP2 in 2050 by 8.7 Gt CO2/yr and 1.9 Gt CO2/yr, respectively (1.5\,{$^\circ$}C scenario compared to baseline). This is achieved by expansion of bioenergy area (516\,Mha in 2050) and reforestation. Expansion of agriculture for food production is reduced due to REDD policy (290\,Mha in 2050) affecting food security especially in Sub-Saharan Africa indicating an important trade-off of land-based mitigation. This set of SSP land-use scenarios provides a comprehensive quantification of interacting trends in the land system, both socio-economic and biophysical. By providing high resolution data, the scenario output can improve interactions between climate research and impact studies.},

  abstract = {Like the preceding article, this article argues that the high costs of reinsurance present the opportunity for hedging instruments to be offered to primary insurers that are both competitive with current reinsurance and that offer investors high rates of return. But the combination of high reinsurance premiums and the vast capacity of the capital market for diversification is not sufficient to ensure the success of these new instruments. If new instruments such as catastrophe options and catastrophelinked bonds are to compete successfully with reinsurance, they must provide a cost-effective means of resolving incentive conflicts between the primary insurer and the ultimate risk bearer that are known as ``moral hazard.'' Without an effective solution of this moral hazard problem, the use of past insurance loss data to estimate the potential returns for purchasers of catastrophe bonds and other such instruments will be misleading and unreliable.             As the author demonstrates, both traditional reinsurance and each of the new catastrophe hedging instruments presents insurance companies and other hedgers with the challenge of managing a different combination of moral hazard, credit risk, and basis risk. For example, traditional catastrophe reinsurance is subject to significant credit risk and moral hazard, but little if any basis risk. By contrast, both catastrophe options and bonds can be designed in ways that reduce moral hazard and credit risk, but at the cost of taking on some basis risk. The risk manager's task in such circumstances is to design an instrument that embodies the optimal, or cost-minimizing, trade-off among these three sources of risk.},

  abstract = {Context Problem-based learning (PBL) is widely used in higher education. There is evidence available that students and faculty are highly satisfied with PBL. Nevertheless, in educational practice problems are often encountered, such as tutors who are too directive, problems that are too well-structured, and dysfunctional tutorial groups. Purpose The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that PBL has the potential to prepare students more effectively for future learning because it is based on four modern insights into learning: constructive, self-directed, collaborative and contextual. These four learning principles are described and it is explained how they apply to PBL. In addition, available research is reviewed and the current debate in research on PBL is described. Discussion It is argued that problems encountered in educational practice usually stem from poor implementation of PBL. In many cases the way in which PBL is implemented is not consistent with the current insights on learning. Furthermore, it is argued that research on PBL should contribute towards a better understanding of why and how the concepts of constructive, self-directed, collaborative and contextual learning work or do not work and under what circumstances. Examples of studies are given to illustrate this issue.},

The Anthropocene qualitatively differs from previous eras in Earth?s history in three key characteristics: (1) There is planetary-scale human agency. (2) There are social and economic networks of teleconnections spanning the globe. (3) It is dominated by planetary-scale social-ecological feedbacks. Bolting together old concepts and methodologies cannot be an adequate approach to describing this new geological era. Instead, we need a new paradigm in Earth System science that is founded equally on a deep understanding of the physical and biological Earth System ? and of the economic, social and cultural forces that are now an intrinsic part of it. It is time to close the loop and bring socially mediated dynamics explicitly into theory, analysis and models that let us study the whole Earth System.},

  abstract = {Background: The Planetary Boundaries concept (PBc) has emerged as a key global sustainability concept in international sustainable development arenas. Initially presented as an agenda for global sustainability research, it now shows potential for sustainability governance. We use the fact that it is widely cited in scientific literature ({$>$}3500 citations) and an extensively studied concept to analyse how it has been used and developed since its first publication. Design: From the literature that cites the PBc, we select those articles that have the terms `planetary boundaries' or `safe operating space' in either title, abstract or keywords. We assume that this literature substantively engages with and develops the PBc. Results: We find that 6\% of the citing literature engages with the concept. Within this fraction of the literature we distinguish commentaries---that discuss the context and challenges to implementing the PBc, articles that develop the core biogeophysical concept and articles that apply the concept by translating to sub-global scales and by adding a human component to it. Applied literature adds to the concept by explicitly including society through perspectives of impacts, needs, aspirations and behaviours. Discussion: Literature applying the concept does not yet include the more complex, diverse, cultural and behavioural facet of humanity that is implied in commentary literature. We suggest there is need for a positive framing of sustainability goals---as a Safe Operating Space rather than boundaries. Key scientific challenges include distinguishing generalised from context-specific knowledge, clarifying which processes are generalizable and which are scalable, and explicitly applying complex systems' knowledge in the application and development of the PBc. We envisage that opportunities to address these challenges will arise when more human social dimensions are integrated, as we learn to feed the global sustainability vision with a plurality of bottom-up realisations of sustainability.},

On the back of the ongoing greening in investment preferences, we focus on investors' group behaviour with respect to U.S. energy equities, which lie at the crossroads in this energy transition phase from an old technology that relies heavily on oil, to a new, greener one. Based on a dynamic herding metric, we find that changes in investors' behaviour with respect to green asset allocations require a better information set than in the case of crude oil allocations, for which only information on returns is a relevant driver of behaviour. We argue that policy uncertainty is better than financial risk proxies in reflecting the multidimensional nature of uncertainty and the various risks associated with investing in green energy today. Our findings suggest the need to reduce uncertainty stemming from the policy realm, given its raising impact on investors' portfolios on the back of higher allocations towards greener assets.},

To a large extent the allocation of SR investments to more sustainable companies and ethical practices is based on the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) scores provided by rating agencies. However, a thorough investigation of ESG scores is a neglected topic in the literature. This paper uses Thomson Reuters ASSET4 ESG ratings to analyze the influence of firm size, a company's available resources for providing ESG data, and the availability of a company's ESG data on the company's sustainability performance. We find a significant positive correlation between the stated variables, which can be explained by organizational legitimacy. The results raise the question of whether the way the ESG score measures corporate sustainability gives an advantage to larger firms with more resources while not providing SR investors with the information needed to make decisions based on their beliefs. Due to our results, SR investors and scholars should reopen the discussion about: what sustainability rating agencies measure with ESG scores, what exactly needs to be measured, and if the sustainable finance community can reach their self-imposed objectives with this measurement.},

  abstract = {The conservation of biodiversity is a major environmental issue, one that promises to remain at or near the top of the environmental agenda for the foreseeable future. The loss of biodiversity affects human welfare as well as being lamentable for its own sake. Humans depend on natural systems to produce a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services, ranging from direct use of certain species for food or medicines to ecosystem functions that provide water purification, nutrient retention or climate regulation. Threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and fragmentation, the introduction of nonindigenous species, over-harvesting, pollution, changes in geochemical cycles and climate change. Sustaining biodiversity in the face of increasing human populations and increased human economic activity promises to be a major challenge. Economists have an important role to play in helping to develop and evaluate conservation strategies. Because biodiversity is at risk in large part because of human activity, finding ways to conserve biodiversity will come from better understanding and management of human affairs, not from better biology alone. Economists can help set priorities to allocate scarce conservation resources where they will do the most good. Economists can help design incentive schemes to make conservation policy both effective and efficient. Economic methods can shed light on what are the most valuable components of biodiversity, including analysis of species existence value, the value of bioprospecting and the value of ecosystem services.},

The analysis of collective beliefs through five periods of RI leads us to define two theoretical dimensions---justifying RI and practicing RI---that characterize how mainstream actors collectively make sense of RI. The authors' analysis reveals that the RI collective beliefs currently (a) do not provide a favorable environment for RI mainstreaming and (b) need to be taken into account when discussing the value of sustainability.},

The United Nations has christened the years 2005--2014 ``The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development'' and has called upon universities ``to make education for sustainability a central focus of higher education curricula, research, physical operations, student life, and outreach to local, regional, and global communities.'' Nevertheless, the indeterminacy of sustainability as a concept has challenged those designing university sustainability efforts, in terms of both campus planning and curricula. Some instructors and campus sustainability planners have chosen to stabilize sustainability concepts into a technical and ethical ``greenprint'' based on some agreement concerning shared (or imposed) concepts and values. Yet others have realized that this is not a problem to be ``solved'' but instead presents an opportunity to advance and implement alternative approaches to teaching and learning ``post-normal'' or ``Mode 2'' science. This article describes a curricular design that attempts to maintain both canonical disciplinary learning about the techniques of sustainability and training in the reflexive skills necessary to explore sustainable change through post-normal learning processes, which we delineate as three ``modes of knowing.'' By training students to practice these ways of knowing sustainability, they come to understand the ``how'' of sustainable practice, process, and design, while allowing the ``what'' of sustainability to emerge from group interaction in a collaborative context.},

An investor's impact in its foreign investments depends on its country-of-domicile and its type, with European investors and pension plans having the largest impact. Theoretically, such variation could arise if certain countries care more about E\&S and investment managers domiciled in these countries are influenced by their social norms. Using measures of country-level E\&S norms, we find such evidence. Investors in general, and independent investment advisors in particular, increase E\&S performance when they come from countries where there is strong community belief in the importance of E\&S, but not otherwise. Overall, our results indicate that institutional investors transplant their social norms into the firms they hold around the world.},

The studies applied Ajzen's (1991) theory of planned behaviour. In each case the application for shares was accurately predicted by measured intention. Intention was in turn explained by attitude, subjective norm, perceived control and past behaviour. At a more specific level the research demonstrated the strong influence of friends and relatives and the importance of easy access to funds as well as the financial criteria of profit and security of investment. The research was used to test aspects of planned behaviour theory and two matters were considered in detail. The first matter was the conditions under which a measure of perceived control improved on the prediction of behaviour obtained from intention alone. The second matter was the association between product sum variables and globally measured variables; in the theory these are equated but rather low correlations are often found. {\copyright} 1993.},

The investors were evenly split between asset owners and asset managers, equity and fixed income, and across the three regions of the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa. The survey explored reasons for ESG investing; the barriers to such investing and investor approaches to overcoming them; and the time frames used for making investment decisions, evaluating the performance of managers, and awarding compensation. The authors report finding that the commonly perceived barriers to ESG integration\&\#8212;the belief that ESG integration requires sacrificing returns, that fiduciary duty prevents one from doing so, and unrealistically short\&\#8208;term expectations for ESG to deliver outperformance\&\#8212;were not as great as commonly believed. The biggest barrier is the lack of high quality data about the performance of companies on their material ESG factors\&\#8212;a scarcity that the authors attribute to the lack of standards for measuring ESG performance and the lack of ESG performance data reported by companies. The results were very similar between asset owners and asset managers, equity and fixed income, and across regions. However, the investment horizons of asset owners were notably longer than those of asset managers, and the same was true of equity vs. fixed income investors. Investors in the Americas were more patient about time frames for seeing outperformance from ESG, while those in Asia Pacific were the least patient. There were also differences across regions in how to overcome the barriers to ESG integration.},

Based on in-depth interviews with the organizations' founders and historical document analysis, we recap the history of the cases and show how different origins, philosophies, and ``purposes'' of ESG issues shaped the methods and data characteristics of two of the most important data vendors of their time. We discuss why MSCI chose to continue with the financial value--oriented methodology of Innovest while discontinuing the values-driven KLD methodology. Through an in-depth literature analysis, we further show that not only the creation but also the use of ``nonfinancial performance'' concepts rely on processes of social construction. We also show that investors use different ESG data from those used by academics, potentially leading to misaligned narratives. Finally, with this article we join the call for more explicit contextualization of ESG data, highlighting that both practitioners and academics need to better understand the social construction that underlies analyses that use different concepts of ESG.},

True believers wish to keep practicing ESG but call it something different; opportunists recognize that an ESG label no longer helps launch funds or attract customers; opponents seek to ban ESG outright. But if ESG is to be scrapped, what do we replace it with? Retiring the term but continuing the practice fails to address the legitimate challenges to ESG; abandoning the practice throws the baby out with the bathwater. This article proposes an alternative: ``Rational Sustainability''. Sustainability refers to the goal -- the creation of long-term value rather than the ticking of ESG boxes -- which is of interest to all job titles and political leanings. Rational refers to the approach: it recognizes diminishing returns and trade-offs; it is based on evidence and analysis; and guards against irrational sustainability bubbles. Rational Sustainability is not a rebranding or a name change, but a fundamental shift in the practice of ESG to the informed creation of long-term value.},

An example is ocean acidification which is a growing concern in fishing and aquaculture economies worldwide, but has remained a footnote in environmental policy at all governance levels. However, existing legal jurisdictions do account for some aspects of the system relating to ocean acidification and these may be leveraged to support adapting to and mitigating ocean acidification. We refine and apply a methodological framework that helps objectively evaluate governance, from a social-ecological systems perspective. We assess how well a set of extant US institutions fits with the social-ecological interactions pertinent to ocean acidification. The assessment points to measured legal gaps, for which we evaluate the government authorities most appropriate to help fill these gaps. The analysis is conducted on United State federal statutes and regulations. Results show quantitative improvement of institutional fit over time (2006 to 2013), but a substantial number of measured legal gaps persist especially around acknowledging local sources of acidification and adaptation strategies to deal with or avoid impacts. We demonstrate the utility of this framework to evaluate the governance surrounding any emerging environmental threat as a first step to guiding the development of jurisdictionally realistic solutions.},

To our knowledge, these are the first comprehensive metal supply and demand scenarios to be developed. We find that copper demand increases by between 275 and 350\% by 2050, depending on the scenario. The scenario with the highest prospective demand is not Market First (a ``business as usual'' vision), but Equitability First, a scenario of transition to a world of more equitable values and institutions. These copper demands exceed projected copper mineral resources by mid-century and thereafter. Energy demand for copper production also demonstrates strong increases, rising to as much as 2.4\% of projected 2050 overall global energy demand. We investigate possible policy responses to these results, concluding that improving the efficiency of the copper cycle and encouraging the development of copper-free energy distribution on the demand side, and improving copper recycling rates on the supply side are the most promising of the possible options. Improving energy efficiency in primary copper production would lead to a reduction in the energy demand by 0.5\% of projected 2050 overall global energy demand. In addition, encouraging the shift towards renewable technologies is important to minimize the impacts associated with copper production.},

As in other work, these scenarios are not predictions, but rather stories of possible futures that have the purpose of providing perspective and contemplating policy options. We report herein on our results for nickel supply and demand under four scenarios. We find that calculated nickel demand increases by 140--175\% by 2025 and 215--350\% by 2050, depending on the scenario. The scenario with the highest prospective demand is termed Equitability World, a scenario of transition to a world of more equitable values and institutions. From the perspective of the results for the four scenarios, we conclude that nickel demands could be met until at least 2050 given known geological nickel resources.

We provide evidence that when initial controls are strong and subsequently weakened, individuals behave in a more self-interested manner in subsequent settings than individuals who are in a setting where initial controls are weak and subsequently strengthened. We also provide evidence that individuals conform more to social norms that conflict with the behavior that changes in formal controls induce. Finally, we find that individuals preferentially attend and conform to the self-interested actions of peers (as opposed to the socially interested actions of their peers), causing self-interested norms to be ``stickier'' than socially interested norms for behavior.},

  abstract = {This appendix is meant to provide a brief review of the literature with regard to environmental and social impacts from mining, as well as key regulatory issues. Key Environmental and Social Impacts Environmental and social impacts of mining have been well-documented and an ample literature exists on this topic. The following discussion summarizes those environmental and social issues that formed the basis for the Mining and Critical Ecosystems framework. Environmental and social impacts are divided into waste management issues, impacts to biodiversity and habitat, indirect impacts, and poverty alleviation and wealth distribution. Those seeking additional details may wish to consult the many resources available on this topic. 1 Waste Management By nature, mining involves the production of large quantities of waste, in some cases contributing significantly to a nation's total waste output. For example, a large proportion of the materials flows inputs and outputs in the United States can be attributed to fossil fuels, coal, and metal mining (Matthews et al., 2000:107). The amount of waste produced depends on the type of mineral extracted, as well as the size of the mine. Gold and silver are among the most wasteful metals, with more than 99 percent of ore extracted ending up as waste. By contrast, iron mining is less wasteful, with approximately 60 percent of the ore extracted processed as waste (Da Rosa, 1997; Sampat, 2003). Disposing of such large quantities of waste poses tremendous challenges for the mining industry and may significantly impact the environment. The impacts are often more pronounced for open-pit mines than for underground mines, which tend to produce less waste. Degradation of aquatic ecosystems and receiving water bodies, often involving substantial reductions in water quality, can be among the most severe potential impacts of metals extraction. Pollution of water bodies results from three primary factors: sedimentation, acid drainage, and metals deposition.},

While studies find that these risks are starting to be priced, concerns are growing that current prices do not fully reflect the risks.

First, the aggregate nature of climate risks limits the availability of risk-sharing arrangements and hedging instruments. Second, the high degree of uncertainty about climate risks and concrete policy actions to address them heightens modelling and measurement challenges.

To examine society's perception of SRI, we conducted a field survey among Spanish investors. The results show that SRI is at an early stage and Spanish investors need more exact information regarding social, environmental, and governance criteria in order to invest in socially responsible companies and products. This paper offers some guidelines that could be used by Spanish institutions, managers and investors and by foreign managers when approaching the Spanish market, in order to promote the growth of socially responsible financial products.

In this context, the objective of this paper is, on the one hand, to understand how criteria used by ESG rating agencies in their assessment processes have evolved over the last ten years and, on the other hand, to analyze whether ESG rating agencies are contributing to fostering sustainable development by the inclusion of sustainability principles into their assessment processes and practices according to the ESG criteria. This research is based on a comparative descriptive analysis of the public information provided by themost representative ESG rating and information provider agencies in the financial market in two periods: 2008 and 2018. The findings show that ESG rating agencies have integrated new criteria into their assessment models to measure corporate performance more accurately and robustly in order to respond to new global challenges. However, a deep analysis of the criteria also shows that ESG rating agencies do not fully integrate sustainability principles into the corporate sustainability assessment process.},

This debate also involves the development of banking regulation tools able to serve the transition. Building on previous works, we propose a method to weight banks' assets that combines conventional financial risks and environmental risks to calculate prudential capital requirements, and we apply it to the EU Taxonomy's technical screening criteria to build an environmental risk indicator based on the buildings' energy consumptions. We show how to calculate the tool endogenously for the taxonomy sections related to buildings (new construction, purchase of building, renovation), thus proving its immediate enforceability, using data from the Lombardy's housing stocks. Finally, we conduct a stress test for the Italian banking system showing that our proposal would be an effective incentive for the banks to fund the green transition of the construction sector.

  abstract = {To achieve the ambitious aims of the Paris climate agreement, the majority of fossil-fuel reserves needs to remain underground. As current national government commitments to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are insufficient by far, actors such as institutional and private investors and the social movement on divestment from fossil fuels could play an important role in putting pressure on national governments on the road to decarbonization. Using a stochastic agent-based model of co-evolving financial market and investors' beliefs about future climate policy on an adaptive social network, here we find that the dynamics of divestment from fossil fuels shows potential for social tipping away from a fossil-fuel based economy. Our results further suggest that socially responsible investors have leverage: a small share of 10--20{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\% of such moral investors is sufficient to initiate the burst of the carbon bubble, consistent with the Pareto Principle. These findings demonstrate that divestment has potential for contributing to decarbonization alongside other social movements and policy instruments, particularly given the credible imminence of strong international climate policy. Our analysis also indicates the possible existence of a carbon bubble with potentially destabilizing effects to the economy.},

Several likely reasons for the positive excess returns in sin stocks are identified.

However, the characteristics of provisioning systems remain poorly understood. Here, we make a new contribution to conceptualising provisioning systems and to understanding differences in the resource efficiency with which they achieve social outcomes. We define a provisioning system as a set of related elements that work together in the transformation of resources to satisfy a foreseen human need. We analyse six theories in terms of their contribution to understanding provisioning systems within the biophysical and social constraints of Raworth's ``Safe and Just Space'' framework. We find that most of these theories fail to prioritise human needs and well-being, and do not incorporate explicit environmental limits. However, they provide important insights that we draw upon to identify six important provisioning system elements (households, markets, the commons, the state, techniques, and material stocks). Based on the theories, we also identify two important relationships between elements, namely feedbacks and power relations. We further propose the concept of ``appropriating systems'' as a component of provisioning systems. Appropriating systems reduce the resource efficiency of human well-being via rent extraction, and act as a barrier to meeting human needs at a sustainable level of resource use. We combine these concepts into a new framework, and discuss applications to energy systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents life-cycle environmental impacts and health hazards of the ilmenite and rutile processing routes which are very little explored despite a significant quantity of production worldwide. The study is carried out through a life-cycle environmental-impact assessment of the ilmenite and rutile mining production processes in Australia, using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) method under 14 significant impact categories and the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) method for 10 significant impact categories. The dataset is collected from EcoInvent and the Australian Life cycle assessment database considering Australia as the geographic region. The major impact categories are climate change, human health (cancer), human health (non-cancer), ecotoxicity, and eutrophication. The analysis results show that the highest impact is caused in climate change, at 0.295 kg CO2 eq, which is due to the large amount of electricity consumption in the ilmenite extraction process. Then, human toxicity-non cancer effects (4.42E-09 CTUh) and particulate matter (0.000155 kg PM 2.5 eq) are also noteworthy. Water resources depletion is affected due to the chemical emissions from ilmenite ore, which are found to be 0.00163 m3 water eq. Rutile production impacts greatly on climate change at 1.535 kg CO2 eq owing to large-scale electricity consumption. Electricity consumption for rutile also affects human toxicity-non cancer (2.3E-8 CTUh), particulate matter (0.00081 kg PM2.5 eq), and terrestrial eutrophication (0.024 molc N eq). Water-resources depletion from rutile is due to the ore, which are found to be 0.0085 m3 water eq. The comparative assessment between ilmenite and rutile implies that rutile has more impact on the environment than ilmenite due to the electricity consumption and fossil fuel consumption. This result is validated through further analysis using the Cumulative Energy Demand method. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to elucidate that the electricity grid mix from country-to-country contributes to sustainability by reducing the environmental impacts significantly.},

The paper presents valuable insights in identifying the gaps, where should the focus be in the mining and mineral processing industries for a sustainable future. Mining and mineral processing industries have been the key focus of research in many countries due to its increasing sustainability concerns that affect global warming and climate change. Use of heavy equipment that consumes electrical energy, mechanical energy, and an enormous amount of process heat is a key contributor to the overall impacts in the industry. Due to the use of heavy equipment and associated energy consumption, these industrial sectors contribute notably to global warming, human health, ecosystems, and resources. Among the various environmental impact assessment tools which are widely used to identify sustainability indicators, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a well-justified approach among the practitioners and researchers. Though state of the art technological tools and resources are being used now a days, there is still a research gap in identifying the key mining processes which need to be the focus of attention. Renewable energy integration in the mineral processing sector and process heating from green energy sources is becoming the emergent field of research. The review results reveal, the assessment indicators in human health and ecosystems are key factors that are mostly missing in the previous studies which are crucial for people or community living nearby mining area. This review paper identifies the research gaps to the existing literature that can form the base for future research direction in the field of LCA and sustainable energy integration in mining and mineral processing industries.},

  abstract = {Gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper are valuable non-ferrous metals that paved the way for modern civilisation. However, the environmental impacts from their beneficiation stage was always overlooked. This paper analysed the life cycle environmental impacts from the beneficiation process of gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper combined production. The analysis is conducted by utilising the SimaPro software version 8.5. The life cycle assessment methodologies followed are the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) method, the IMPACT 2002+ method, and the Cumulative Energy Demand Method (CED). The most significant impact categories are ecotoxicity, climate change, human toxicity, eutrophication, acidification, and ozone depletion among nearly 15 impact categories which are assessed in this study. The analysis results from the ILCD method indicate that there is a noteworthy impact on ionising radiation caused by the beneficiation process. Out of the five metals considered, gold and silver beneficiation impacts the most while lead-zinc beneficiation impacts the least. Gold beneficiation has most impacts on the category of climate change and ecosystems. Other major impact categories are ionising radiation, terrestrial eutrophication, photochemical ozone formation, human toxicity, and acidification. The IMPACT 2002+ method shows the overall impact is on ecosystem quality and human health from this combined beneficiation process, dominantly from gold-silver beneficiation. The life-cycle inventory results show that the blasting process and the amount of electricity consumption in the beneficiation process contribute to cause significant amount of environmental impacts. The comparative impact results are presented and discussed in detail in this paper. Sensitivity analyses are presented based on various electricity grid-mix scenarios and energy-mix scenarios, and the results suggest that electricity grid mix has a dominant effect over the fossil-fuel mix. This paper also highlights the potential steps which could cut down the environmental effects by integrating renewable-energy technologies.},

  abstract = {Gold and silver are extracted through the gold-silver couple production process or the gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper combined production process. This paper aims to analyse and compare the life-cycle assessment (LCA)of the gold and silver refining processes. Two production routes are considered in this study: gold and silver refining through the gold-silver couple production process and gold and silver refining which are produced from the gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper combined production process. SimaPro software version 8.5 is used for the life-cycle assessment using the International Life Cycle Reference Data (ILCD)method and the cumulative energy demand method (CED). The geographic region considered in the original dataset is based on Papua New Guinea and Sweden. The major impact categories from the ILCD methods are climate change, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer effects), ecotoxicity, ionising radiation (human health and ecotoxicity), eutrophication (freshwater, marine, and terrestrial), land use, water use, and mineral resources depletion. The impact categories where the results are analysed and presented here from the CED method are renewables, fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas), biomass, nuclear, and embodied energy. The analysis results indicate that between gold-silver couple production and gold silver combined metal production process, refining through the gold-silver couple production process have greater environmental impacts. Furthermore, gold refining effects are larger as compared to the silver refining process. Among the significant impact categories, the most crucial is human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer). Results from the cumulative energy demand method shows that fossil-fuel consumption is larger than all other sources of energy demand in the precious-metal refining process.},

This cradle-to-gate analysis is carried out using SimaPro software version 8.5. The considered case is the manganese beneficiation and refining process, and the final product is 1 kg of refined manganese. The global average dataset is collected from the EcoInvent and AusLCI database, which are originated from literature source. The analysis methodologies considered in this study are the International Life Cycle Reference Data System (ILCD) method and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) method. A comparative analysis is also presented which compared among ILCD, Australian Indicator, and Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) methods to identify the best practice method for global analysis of mining processes. A detailed sensitivity analysis has been carried out considering different scenarios, to suggest possible solutions to reduce the environmental impacts associated with manganese beneficiation and refining processes. The analysis results reveal that particulate matter, climate change, categories of eutrophication, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer effects), and acidification are some of the noteworthy impact categories. The analysis results also showed that coal consumption is significantly higher than other types of renewables and non-renewable energy consumption in manganese beneficiation and refining processes. The analysis results further reveal that using the chromium steel in manganese beneficiation process and ferromanganese consumption in the refining process has a significant effect over other materials involved in manganese beneficiation and refining operations. The obvious reason behind this result is ferromanganese utilization as an energy-intensive process, which in turn increases the environmental emissions. The analysis results also showed that, between the beneficiation and refining process, manganese refining has a much greater impact on the environment rather than the beneficiation process due to the fossil fuel and electricity consumption in refining operations.},

  abstract = {Modelling the economics of climate change is daunting. Many existing methodologies from social and physical sciences need to be deployed, and new modelling techniques and ideas still need to be developed. Existing bread-and-butter micro- and macroeconomic tools, such as the expected utility framework, market equilibrium concepts and representative agent assumptions, are far from adequate. Four key issues---along with several others---remain inadequately addressed by economic models of climate change, namely: (1) uncertainty, (2) aggregation, heterogeneity and distributional implications (3) technological change, and most of all, (4) realistic damage functions for the economic impact of the physical consequences of climate change. This paper assesses the main shortcomings of two generations of climate-energy-economic models and proposes that a new wave of models need to be developed to tackle these four challenges. This paper then examines two potential candidate approaches---dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models and agent-based models (ABM). The successful use of agent-based models in other areas, such as in modelling the financial system, housing markets and technological progress suggests its potential applicability to better modelling the economics of climate change.},

Given the social and environmental challenges ahead, such practices and their unacceptable outcomes cannot be sustained. Therefore, a shift in paradigm is called for.

In a production economy with constant returns to scale, firms' demand for capital is infinitely elastic, and mandates can significantly impact the allocation of capital across sectors despite having a negligible impact on the cost of capital. This is in sharp contrast to an endowment economy where inelastic demand for capital implies equilibrium price reactions to mandates, which significantly reduce their effectiveness. Within a canonical real-business-cycle model calibrated to match key asset-pricing and macroeconomic moments, we estimate that a significant portion of the mandate remains effective in shaping equilibrium capital allocation, even when there is little disparity in the cost of capital across sectors. Our analysis challenges the common practice of judging the effectiveness of portfolio mandates by their impact on firms' cost of capital.},

We propose a ``conviction driven" and normative view of metamodernism. We detail its differences with non-normative metamodernism, and explain the metamodern politics and policies envisioned by it. We expose the advantages of metamodernism as a conceptual framework to approach scientific research, and discuss some of its implicit alignments and complementarities with the field of futures and foresight. Finally, for its deliberate potential to solve interlocking crises at the social level, we conclude by advocating the establishment of an applied practice of metamodern foresight: the creation, evaluation and comparison of several normative civilizational futures, some of which have to be metamodern futures.},

The evaluation included the classification and characterization of life cycle impacts, not including normalization and weighting as well as sensitivity analysis of results. The evaluation of impacts used SimaPro-7, Ecoinvent 2.0, Eco indicator'99 and IPCC 2007. The results indicated that the use of grinding media in the processes is the main source of environmental impacts in the iron ore production chain, highlighting its contribution to life cycle impacts on human health and quality of ecosystems. Ore transportation by conveyor belts powered by electricity was more efficient in relation to the generation of impacts on the abiotic resources depletion and on climate changes than ore transportation by diesel trucks because the electricity generation matrix in Brazil has significant participation from hydroelectric plants.},

  abstract = {Purpose: As an emerging field of financing, impact investing is under-institutionalised and is in a legitimacy building phase. In an attempt to unpack how impact investing is deployed in global markets, the key elements of its definition (intentionality, returns and measurement) are examined through a review of academic and practitioner literature. A refined definition is developed which emphasises the key elements of intentionality and measurement as separating impact investment from the established field of socially responsible investment (SRI). Design/methodology/approach: Funds and products from a publicly available database are systematically analysed against the refined definition to determine the rigour with which intentionality and measurement are applied by self-identified market participants. These elements are used as a proxy to determine ``purpose-washing'' -- a process where funds are presented as impact investments but do not satisfy a tightly applied definition. Purpose-washing enables the possibility of ``retrofitting'', where funds originally defined as other products (e.g. SRI) retrospectively claim to be impact investments. Findings: Having found evidence of purpose-washing but not retrofitting, actions are identified to enhance impact investment's integrity, focussing on intentionality, measurement and transparency. Clarity of definition and purpose are important for a field in the market-building phase, as a lack of clarity could have negative implications for integrity and growth. The authors postulate that purpose-washing may be attributed to twin but distinctive motivations by market participants: interest in fee-generation among fund managers and attempts to bolster field legitimacy by demonstrating sector growth among impact investing proponents. Originality value: This paper represents a unique analysis of impact investments against a robust and refined definition. By doing so, it offers a systematic appraisal of impact investments and an overall assessment of market integrity in its field-building phase.},

Background: Soft skills have been expounded repeatedly as a crucial factor to thrive in the workplace, as opposed to mere knowledge of content only, since the increasingly importance of practitioners being able to adapt to new situations. Also, soft skills have the ability to categorize specific career attribute which an individual has, such as team spirit, written and oral communication, leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Literature provides evidence of areas in which graduates most frequently do not meet industry expectations, including technical and also soft skills. Intended Outcomes: Considering the aforementioned scenario, an active learning strategy was adopted aiming to foster soft skills, particularly, oral communication, and negotiation in an Entrepreneurship course. Application Design: The course final project comprised the development of fictional business plans, their corresponding minimum viable products, and also negotiation rounds with fictional potential investors. Among the active learning strategies, role-playing games were chosen as they have shown to be useful in similar contexts. Findings: This experience shows that active strategies, especially role-playing games, support the development of soft skills and engage students as active participants in their learning process.},

We find five distinct clusters of forest commons, with co-benefits and trade-offs on multiple dimensions. The presence of a formal community management association and local participation in rule-making are consistent predictors of multiple positive outcomes. These findings, drawn from a range of contexts globally, suggest that empowered local forest governance may support multiple objectives of forest restoration. Our analysis advances understanding of institutional aspects of restoration while underscoring the importance of analysing the interconnections among multiple forest benefits to inform effective interventions for multifunctional tropical forests.},

The increased demand for higher sectoral, temporal, and spatial resolution to conduct impact analyses has led to a number of challenges both computationally and conceptually. Overcoming these challenges and moving the field forward will require not only greater efforts in model coupling software and translational tools, the incorporation of empirical findings into integrated assessment models, and intermethod comparisons but also the expansion and better coordination of multidisciplinary researchers in this field through better training of the next generation of integrated assessment scholars and expanding the community of practice.},

  author = {Flammer, Caroline and Giroux, Thomas and Heal, Geoffrey M},
  abstract = {The use of private capital to finance biodiversity conservation and restoration is a new practice in sustainable finance. This study sheds light on this new practice. First, we provide a conceptual framework that lays out how biodiversity can be financed by i) pure private capital and ii) blended financing structures. In the latter, private capital is blended with public or philanthropic capital, whose aim is to de-risk private capital investments. The main element underlying both types of financing is the ``monetization'' of biodiversity, that is, using investments in biodiversity to generate a financial return for private investors. Second, we provide empirical evidence using deal-level data from a leading biodiversity finance institution. We find that projects with higher expected returns tend to be financed by pure private capital. Their scale is smaller, however, and so is their expected biodiversity impact. For larger-scale projects with a more ambitious biodiversity impact, blended finance is the more prevalent form of financing. While these projects have lower expected returns, their risk is also lower. This suggests that the blending---and the corresponding de-risking of private capital---is an important tool for improving the risk-return tradeoff of these projects, thereby increasing their appeal to private investors. Finally, we examine a set of projects that did not make it to the portfolio stage. This analysis suggests that, in order to be financed by private capital, biodiversity projects need to meet a certain threshold in terms of both their financial return and their biodiversity impact. Accordingly, private capital is unlikely to substitute for the implementation of effective public policies in addressing the biodiversity crisis.},

  abstract = {The resilience perspective is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems. This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960-1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social-ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge-system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services. {\copyright} 2006.},

These aspects interrelate across multiple scales. Resilience in this context is the capacity of a SES to continually change and adapt yet remain within critical thresholds. Adaptability is part of resilience. It represents the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers and internal processes and thereby allow for development along the current trajectory (stability domain). Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales. The capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience and knowledge to navigate social-ecological transitions. Society must seriously consider ways to foster resilience of smaller more manageable SESs that contribute to Earth System resilience and to explore options for deliberate transformation of SESs that threaten Earth System resilience. {\copyright} 2010 by the author(s).},

We show that a handful of transnational corporations have become a major force shaping the global intertwined system of people and planet. Transnational corporations in agriculture, forestry, seafood, cement, minerals and fossil energy cause environmental impacts and possess the ability to influence critical functions of the biosphere. We review evidence of current practices and identify six observed features of change towards `corporate biosphere stewardship', with significant potential for upscaling. Actions by transnational corporations, if combined with effective public policies and improved governmental regulations, could substantially accelerate sustainability efforts.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textpm}1{$\sigma$}. For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1 \% relative to 2020, with fossil emissions at 10.1 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1 (9.9 {\textpm} 0.5 GtC yr-1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1 {\textpm} 0.7 GtC yr-1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 10.9 {\textpm} 0.8 GtC yr-1 (40.0 {\textpm} 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2 {\textpm} 0.2 GtC yr-1 (2.5 {\textpm} 0.1 ppm yr-1), SOCEAN was 2.9 {\textpm} 0.4 GtC yr-1, and SLAND was 3.5 {\textpm} 0.9 GtC yr-1, with a BIM of -0.6 GtC yr-1 (i.e. the total estimated sources were too low or sinks were too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2021 reached 414.71 {\textpm} 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0 \% (0.1 \% to 1.9 \%) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2 ppm, more than 50 \% above pre-industrial levels (around 278 ppm). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959--2021, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr-1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set.

We show that CSR activities are driven by institutional investors with long investment horizons, and that this is due to the reputation insurance that CSR spending provides. Specifically, longer horizon investors benefit more from such insurance, and so do their agents, the investment managers that interact with portfolio firms. Additional tests show that this positive relationship between shareholder horizons and CSR is enhanced by market myopia, managerial agency risks, and motivated investors. We address the endogeneity concerns by employing Russell 1000/2000 index switches as sources of exogenous variation in shareholder investment horizons. The influence of shareholder horizons on CSR is also related to social norms. Our main results hold for all but one category of CSR and appear to be driven by CSR strengths.},

  abstract = {Encouraging pro-environmental behavior is an urgent global challenge. An interdisciplinary framework covering governance, economic, social, ecological, and psychological dimensions is required to understand the salient features that encourage pro-environmental outcomes within and across contexts. We apply the Ostrom social-ecological systems framework to model voluntary investments by members of civil society into the aquatic environment. Using a data set of 1,809 angling clubs managing water bodies for fish stocking and habitat management in Germany and France, we show that a small set of factors, most crucially social-ecological and governance context as well as social norms and other bottom-up social pressures, drive environmental investments. These factors appear to override behavioral influences from psychological variables of the decision-maker. By contrast, the contextual setting related to property rights, size of the resource system, and social expectations were found to be strongly related to behavioral decisions, highlighting that the social-ecological context as well as incentives may be more important than knowledge and cognitions in driving certain pro-environmental actions.},

Assets, in particular real estate properties, do not adequately price in climate risks although disclosure and communication help alleviate the mispricing of assets. Further, natural disasters restrict the credit supply from affected banks even in areas not directly hit by the disaster; however, this negative impact is less severe for banks with more capital. Meanwhile, insurance provides some protection for the economy, firms, and households against the impact of natural disasters, but there are several challenges such as low coverage and moral hazard. Finally, our survey considers policy implications for financial authorities.},

The four identified challenges are related to, first, the interplay between Earth system science and global policies, and the implications of differences in risk perceptions in defining these boundaries; second, the capacity of international institutions to deal with individual `planetary boundaries', as well as interactions between them; third, the role of international organizations in dealing with `planetary boundaries' interactions; and fourth, the role of global governance in framing social--ecological innovations.},

  abstract = {Global risks are now increasingly being perceived as networked, and likely to result in large-scale, propagating failures and crises that transgress national boundaries and societal sectors. These so called ``globally networked risks'' pose fundamental challenges to global governance institutions. A growing literature explores the nature of these globally networked or ``systemic'' risks. While this research has taught us much about the anatomy of these risks, it has consistently failed to integrate insights from the wider social sciences. This is problematic since the prescriptions that result from these efforts flow from na{\cyrchar\cyryi}ve assumptions about the way real-world state and non-state actors behave in the international arena. This leaves serious gaps in our understanding of whether networked environmental risks at all can be governed. The following essay brings together decades of research by different disciplines in the social sciences, and identifies five multi-disciplinary key insights that can inform global approaches to governing these. These insights include the influence of international institutions; the dynamics and effect of international norms and legal mechanisms; the need for international institutions to cope with transboundary and cross-sectoral crises; the role of innovation as a strategy to handle unpredictable global risks; and the necessity to address legitimacy issues.},

We combine Earth system and sustainability sciences with corporate finance to develop a methodology that allows us to link financial actors to economic activities modifying biomes of key importance for stabilizing Earth's climate system. Our analysis of key owners of companies operating in the Amazon rainforest (Brazil) and boreal forests (Russia and Canada) identifies a small set of international financial actors with considerable, but as of yet unrealized, globally spanning influence. We denote these ``Financial Giants'', and elaborate how incentives and disincentives currently influence their potential to bolster or undermine the stability of the Earth's climate system.},

Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are already today being applied in a number of research fields related to climate change and environmental monitoring. Investments into applications of these technologies in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these sectors.},

Artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) of alluvial diamonds represents an important source of alternative income for subsistence farmers, but it also leads to several socio-environmental impacts: deforestation, river pollution, water resources exploitation, unhealthy, unregulated and sometimes dangerous work environments. We perform a data-driven comprehensive analysis of the impact of the diamond mining industry on natural resources and assess the potential relevance of these resources to the DRC food system. To this end, we evaluate land and water resources consumption associated with diamond mining from 2001 to 2018, cross-referencing high-resolution data on mines, land use and tree cover, and using a dynamic and spatially distributed agro-hydrological model. We leverage disaggregated agrological data to provide alternative resources allocation scenarios, and use subnational development indicators and spatially explicit conflict data to frame our analysis within the socio-economic context. We find that, despite the richness in natural resources of the DRC, the impact of diamond mining is relevant because of its effects on ecology, economy, and society. Resources and efforts currently put into the mining industry may have the potential to alleviate the malnourishment crisis in DRC if diverted towards the construction of a more structured and resilient food system. Phenomena such as the illicit trafficking of diamonds and their use to finance wars contribute to nullify the potential of mining as an alternative source of income for subsistence farmers.},

Critics have asserted that there is a lack of transparency around model structures and input assumptions, a lack of credibility in those input assumptions that are made visible, an over-reliance on particular technologies and an inadequate representation of real-world policies and processes such as innovation and behaviour change. The paper then reviews the proposals and actions that follow from these criticisms, which fall into three broad categories: scrap the models and use other techniques to set out low-carbon futures; transform them by improving their representation of real-world processes and their transparency; and supplement them with other models and approaches. The article considers the implications of each proposal, through the particular lens of how it would explore the role of a key low-carbon technology---bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to produce net negative emissions. The paper concludes that IAMs remain critically important in mitigation pathways analysis, because they can encompass a large number of technologies and policies in a consistent framework, but that they should increasingly be supplemented with other models and analytical approaches.},

The effect of individuals' concerns about the environmental sustainability of their consumption patterns has not only received increased attention from market participants but also from academics. Existing literature which focuses specifically on investments in renewable energies points out that individuals' attitudes are good predictors or moderators of ecologically friendly investment behavior. This study aims to investigate those factors which influence retail investors' attitudes towards investments in renewable energies. The results are based on an online-survey of participants in Germany and reveal that individuals' social norms, their confidence in NGOs, and their evaluation of the relevant regulatory framework significantly influence their attitudes towards investments in renewable energies. Based on a multiple linear regression, it was found that the conceptual model used explains 49\% of individuals' attitudes. The results further reveal that German retail investors can be separated into two groups, namely ``Supporters'' and ``Skeptics'', based on their attitudes towards investments in renewable energies. This study provides important practical implications for the investment community and proposals for future research.},

To examine how lenders account for extreme weather, we compare matched repeat mortgage and property transactions around a severe flood event in England in 2013--14. First, lender valuations do not ``mark-to-market'' against local price declines. As a result valuations are biased upwards. Second, lenders do not offset this valuation bias by adjusting interest rates or loan amounts. Third, borrowers with low credit risk self-select into high flood risk areas. Overall, these results suggest that lenders do not track closely the impact of extreme weather ex-post, and that public flood insurance programs subsidize high income households in some areas.},

The mix consists of a combination of onshore and offshore wind turbines, concentrating solar power stations, hydroelectricity and wave power devices attached to the offshore turbines. Solar photovoltaic power could contribute to the mix if its dependence on scarce materials is solved. The most adequate deployment areas for the power stations are studied, as well as the required space. Material requirements are studied for the generation, power transport and for some future transport systems. The order of magnitude of copper, aluminium, neodymium, lithium, nickel, zinc and platinum that may be required for the proposed solution is obtained and compared with available reserves. Overall, the proposed global alternative to fossil fuels seems technically feasible. However, lithium, nickel and platinum could become limiting materials for future vehicles fleet if no global recycling systems were implemented and rechargeable zinc-air batteries would not be developed; 60\% of the current copper reserves would have to be employed in the implementation of the proposed solution. Altogether, they may become a long-term physical constraint, preventing the continuation of the usual exponential growth of energy consumption. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

On average, the biodiversity footprint does not explain the cross-section of stock returns. However, a biodiversity footprint premium (higher returns for firms with larger footprints) began emerging after the Kunming Declaration (October 2021), which capped the first part of the recent UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15). Consistent with this finding, stocks with large footprints lost value in the days after the Kunming Declaration. Their stock prices dropped further after the Montreal Agreement (December 2022), which concluded the second part of the COP15. The results indicate that investors have started to require a risk premium upon the prospect of, and uncertainty about, future regulations to preserve biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Zero-deforestation commitments are a type of voluntary sustainability initiative that companies adopt to signal their intention to reduce or eliminate deforestation associated with commodities that they produce, trade, and/or sell. Because each company defines its own zero-deforestation commitment goals and implementation mechanisms, commitment content varies widely. This creates challenges for the assessment of commitment implementation or effectiveness. Here, we develop criteria to assess the potential effectiveness of zero-deforestation commitments at reducing deforestation within a company supply chain, regionally, and globally. We apply these criteria to evaluate 52 zero-deforestation commitments made by companies identified by Forest 500 as having high deforestation risk. While our assessment indicates that existing commitments converge with several criteria for effectiveness, they fall short in a few key ways. First, they cover just a small share of the global market for deforestation-risk commodities, which means that their global impact is likely to be small. Second, biome-wide implementation is only achieved in the Brazilian Amazon. Outside this region, implementation occurs mainly through certification programs, which are not adopted by all producers and lack third-party near-real time deforestation monitoring. Additionally, around half of all commitments include zero-net deforestation targets and future implementation deadlines, both of which are design elements that may reduce effectiveness. Zero-net targets allow promises of future reforestation to compensate for current forest loss, while future implementation deadlines allow for preemptive clearing. To increase the likelihood that commitments will lead to reduced deforestation across all scales, more companies should adopt zero-gross deforestation targets with immediate implementation deadlines and clear sanction-based implementation mechanisms in biomes with high risk of forest to commodity conversion.},

We assert that this model still provides important insight to aid in the solution to our global problems. In particular, we maintain that the underlying issues of growth against limits and bounded rationality are still not adequately recognized and addressed; this underlies many of the reasons for our unsustainable world. Examples from fisheries management are used to examine potential solutions and reveal weaknesses in current approaches. We show how our current, restricted mental models promote social injustice and blind us to developing sustainable solutions. Both the neo-liberal economic view of business that directly seeks growth and the new sustainable development view that indirectly supports growth are leading our global economy in the wrong direction and away from prosperity and sustainability. Current thinking has not realized Hardin's message that sustainability is of the class of no technology solution problems. We conclude with recommendations to radically advance a new world view and business paradigm.},

We present an open access set of global data for calculating land use change impacts of agricultural supply chains. These data, originally prepared for the LandGriffon service, include indicators of deforestation, conversion of natural ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions, and loss of intact or high integrity ecosystems following international standards and guidelines for reporting and target setting in the agriculture, forestry, and land use sector. In order to assign impacts to agricultural production, we prepare data using a spatial adaptation of the statistical Land Use Change (sLUC) accounting approach distributing impact to human activities across the local area using a 50km radius. The results are high resolution global maps of impact per hectare of land occupation. These can then be combined with land footprint data, cropland extent, or productivity maps to calculate land use change related impacts for specific crop volumes sourced from specific regions. Carbon and deforestation results are validated against FAO statistics at the national level.},

Our study emphasizes that while climate change represents an important factor in this context, it is by far not the only one. Insurers should thus take a broader approach on managing sustainability risks and opportunities.

Some believe green growth is an option, while others think climate goals are incompatible with growth. It does so by developing a sector-based approach to analyze the relation between on the one hand carbon dioxide emissions per dollar of output and on the other the growth in economic output and labor productivity. This allows us to investigate whether green growth -- combining economic growth with environmental sustainability -- is feasible. The analysis covers Denmark, Germany and Spain for the period 1995--2007. An important innovation of this study is that carbon intensity is calculated in two different ways: (1) as direct carbon dioxide emissions from each sector, which can be seen to immediately result from the processes in the respective sector; and (2) as total, direct plus indirect, emissions, by using environmentally-extended input--output tables and considering also indirect carbon emissions through imported goods. Another novelty of this study is that we calculate correlations over time between sectoral carbon intensity and a range of economic indicators: sectoral total and relative output, final demand, value added, and so-called output and valued-added productivity indicators, and their change. A main conclusion is that despite past climate policy, developed under the Kyoto protocol, relatively clean sectors do not seem to be more productive than dirtier ones, and neither show higher productivity growth. Sectors associated with high carbon intensity grew more in absolute terms than those with low carbon intensity. The share of these sectors increased suggesting that green development requires an extremely rapid pace of decarbonization (to allow for green growth), or the economy as a whole to shrink (green decline).

As a key element of such a revision we suggest a bottom-up quantification of local water availabilities taking account of environmental flow requirements. An analysis that respects these requirements in a spatially explicit manner suggests a PB-Water of {\textasciitilde}2800km3yr-1 (the average of an uncertainty range of 1100-4500km3yr-1). This is notably lower than the earlier suggestion based on a simpler top-down analysis (4000km3yr-1, the lower value of a range of 4000-6000km3yr-1). The new estimate remains provisional, pending further refinement by in-depth analyses of local water accessibility and constraints up-scaled to the global domain, including study of cascading impacts on Earth system properties. With a current blue water consumption of {$>$}1700km3yr-1, PB-Water is being approached rapidly. Thus, design opportunities to remain within PB-Water are imperative. We argue that their quantification requires analysis of tradeoffs with other planetary boundaries such as those for land use and climate change. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.}

We combine insights from performativity studies about calculability with Lukes' `radical view of power' to investigate how multiple facets of power are mobilized to influence the creation and activities of calculative agencies in the process of market construction. An in-depth longitudinal study of the French socially responsible investment market shows how organizations acting as calculative agencies become sites of power through calculability. We identify how power is exercised over, through and against these calculative agencies by a variety of actors in order to build their position in the socially responsible investment market. Our results complement the broader question of the `government of economic life' by showing how micro-level power games interact with the macro-politics of market building through calculative agencies. In so doing, our article sheds light on neglected aspects of the changing geopolitics of calculative power in market construction and suggests approaching `calculability as politics' when studying the construction of markets.},

  abstract = {The targeted transition towards an electricity system with low or even negative greenhouse gas emissions affords a chance to address other environmental concerns as well, but may potentially have to adjust to the limited availability of assorted non-fossil resources. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely recognized as a method appropriate to assess and compare product systems taking into account a wide range of environmental impacts. Yet, LCA could not inform the latest assessment of co-benefits and trade-offs of climate change mitigation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change due to the lack of comparative assessments of different electricity generation technologies addressing a wide range of environmental impacts and using a consistent set of methods. This paper contributes to filling this gap. A consistent set of life cycle inventories of a wide range of electricity generation technologies is assessed using the Recipe midpoint methods. The life-cycle inventory modeling addresses the production and deployment of the technologies in nine different regions. The analysis shows that even though low-carbon power requires a larger amount of metals than conventional fossil power, renewable and nuclear power leads to a reduction of a wide range of environmental impacts, while CO2 capture and storage leads to increased non-GHG impacts. Biomass has relatively modest co-benefits, if at all. The manufacturing of low-carbon technologies is important compared to their operation, indicating that it is important to choose the most desirable technologies from the outset.},

  abstract = {This article is the first in a three-part series whose overall aim is to more precisely define the terms "additionality" and "baseline" in the context of environmental policy and propose a conceptual framework for applying these concepts within offset programs. The elaboration of precise and theoretically well-grounded definitions of these terms is a necessary precursor to their application in real world offset programs in a way that allows programs to operate with both greater credibility and effectiveness. Through a historical analysis and literature review, it is shown that the current language employed to define additionality and baseline in greenhouse gas emissions offset policy is imprecise and that major offset programs and standards are built upon circular definitions. The root of these problems is a failure to explicitly recognize and specify a policy intervention. A failure that has abandoned additionality and baseline assessments to politics and ad hoc justifications. Definitions of additionality and baseline are proposed that are intended to be broadly applicable to offset policies and programs addressing any public goods issue at any scale, from traditional project-based initiatives to new scales transcending traditional offset projects.},

However, knowledge about the individual socially responsible investor is largely limited to descriptive and comparative accounts. The question of "why do some investors practice socially responsible investing and others don't?" is therefore still largely unanswered. To address this shortcoming in the current literature, this paper develops a model of the decision to invest socially responsibly that is grounded in the cognition literature. The hypotheses proposed in the model are tested with an experimental survey. The results indicate that the framing of the investing situation influences the likelihood of engagement in socially responsible investing and how much return the individuals are willing to sacrifice when choosing socially responsible over conventional investments. The study does not find support for a relationship between expectations about corporate social responsibility and the likelihood of engagement in socially responsible investing. {\copyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The uses of PGMs includes catalytic converters for air pollution control in vehicles, growing jewellery use, catalysts for various purposes (especially petroleum and chemicals processing), hydrogen fuel cells, and many others. Given the growing importance of most of these PGM uses in more sustainable technologies or in making industrial processes more efficient, it is critical to understand the complex sustainability issues which surround PGMs. At present, South Africa is the dominant PGMs producer and holds {$\sim$}88\% of estimated global resources, with additional production and resources in Russia, Zimbabwe, Canada and the United States. Given the concentrated location of PGM resources, what are the likely trends in PGM mining with respect to environmental sustainability? That is, what are the costs in terms of energy, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, water, land use impacts, social impacts, economic aspects associated with this globally important industry? This paper compiles and analyses a range of data on PGM mining. It synthesizes a unique combination of data which relates typical production aspects such as ore grade and scale with sustainability aspects such as greenhouse, energy and water costs. The findings are critical in understanding the debate about the increasing environmental and social costs of some materials and technologies which are considered crucial for sustainable technologies based on PGMs. Overall, the paper represents a valuable insight into the environmental and resource sustainability of the PGM sector. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the planetary boundary for human freshwater use has been critiqued as a singular measure that does not reflect all types of human interference with the complex global water cycle and Earth System. We suggest that the water planetary boundary will be more scientifically robust and more useful in decision-making frameworks if it is redesigned to consider more specifically how climate and living ecosystems respond to changes in the different forms of water on Earth: atmospheric water, frozen water, groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water. This paper provides an ambitious scientific road map to define a new water planetary boundary consisting of sub-boundaries that account for a variety of changes to the water cycle.},

  abstract = {The consumption of internationally traded goods causes multiple socio-environmental impacts. Current methods linking production impacts to final consumption typically trace the origin of products back to the country level, lacking fine-scale spatial resolution. This hampers accurate calculation of trade and consumption footprints, masking and distorting the causal links between consumers' choices and their environmental impacts, especially in countries with large spatial variability in socio-environmental conditions and production impacts. Here we present the SEI-PCS model (Spatially Explicit Information on Production to Consumption Systems), which allows for fine-scale sub-national assessments of the origin of, and socio-environmental impacts embedded in, traded commodities. The method connects detailed production data at sub-national scales (e.g., municipalities or provinces), information on domestic flows of goods and in international trade. The model permits the downscaling of country-to-country trade analyses based on either physical allocation from bilateral trade matrices or MRIO models. The importance of producing more spatially-explicit trade analyses is illustrated by identifying the municipalities of Brazil from which different countries source the Brazilian soy they consume. Applications for improving consumption accounting and policy assessment are discussed, including quantification of externalities of consumption, consumer labeling, trade leakages, sustainable resource supply and traceability.},

Similarly, American undergraduates' perceptions were elicited through focus group interviews and questionnnaires. CTAs viewed American college instructors as exciting, but unclear in their organization and presentation. Undergraduates thought ideal US professors should spend more time with their students, and have interpersonal skills in teaching. They did not value the professor's knowledge of the subject matter as much as CTAs did. Implications for future TA development programmes are also discussed.},

We investigate these questions by estimating the causal effect of demand-driven mineral price booms on deforestation near mining sites on a global scale. Combining mine property-level data with high-resolution satellite imagery on forest cover, we find a positive elasticity of deforestation to mineral price shocks. This elasticity is lower when mine owners are from higher-income countries, but it is not affected by host country characteristics. The mechanism is consistent with mine owners from wealthier countries inducing different types of local economic activity and/or the transmission of institutional norms.},

Changes in species diversity and high rates of compositional turnover have been reported worldwide. In many cases, trends in biodiversity are detected, but these trends are rarely causally attributed to possible drivers. A formal framework and guidelines for the detection and attribution of biodiversity change is needed. We propose an inferential framework to guide detection and attribution analyses, which identifies five steps---causal modelling, observation, estimation, detection and attribution---for robust attribution. This workflow provides evidence of biodiversity change in relation to hypothesized impacts of multiple potential drivers and can eliminate putative drivers from contention. The framework encourages a formal and reproducible statement of confidence about the role of drivers after robust methods for trend detection and attribution have been deployed. Confidence in trend attribution requires that data and analyses used in all steps of the framework follow best practices reducing uncertainty at each step. We illustrate these steps with examples. This framework could strengthen the bridge between biodiversity science and policy and support effective actions to halt biodiversity loss and the impacts this has on ecosystems.

The ability of role-play pedagogy to develop these competencies was assessed through a case study of students in a first-year subject/course at an Australian university. Analysis of the students' written comments indicate that the students were involved in significant learning, and had made substantial progress in developing five key skills for sustainability. The enjoyment and engagement they demonstrated was an added benefit of their experience and potentially of the role-play approach. While it is acknowledged that a role-play requires careful planning and support, and may be considered resource intensive, it can be argued that the student learning achieved is worth the effort.},

This paper argues that these new theoretical and empirical findings are largely ignored in applied work and policy applications in environmental economics. As the only heterodox school of economics focusing on the human economy both as a social system and as one imbedded in the biophysical universe, and thus both holistic and scientifically based, ecological economics is poised to play a leading role in recasting the scope and method of economic science.},

The author discusses the mechanics of both externally enforced and internalized social norms, showing that both could be valuable for making progress on environmental issues. Because climate change is a large-number, negative pay-off problem, however, effective enforcement of externally enforced norms within a narrow rational choice frame-work is challenging. As a result, the Article argues that an expanded conception of rational choice is required in order for a theory of internalized norms to be accurate and to aid in the development of climate change policy. Specifically contemplating the effect of subsidies on individuals' emissions, the author notes that, while the role that government and the law can play in norm-creation is not entirely clear, subsidies in general can have a weak (and possibly even negative) effect on social norms pertaining to environmental values, and thus should not be a central tool for addressing climate change.},

  abstract = {Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 {$^\circ$}C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify ``natural climate solutions'' (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS---when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation---is 23.8 petagrams of CO               2               equivalent (PgCO               2               e) y               -1               (95\% CI 20.3--37.4). This is {$\geq$}30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO               2               e y               -1               ) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO               2               pollution is {$\geq$}100 USD MgCO               2               e               -1               by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO               2               mitigation needed through 2030 for a {$>$}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 {$^\circ$}C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO               2               -1               . Most NCS actions---if effectively implemented---also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

  abstract = {We analyze how stylized Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), and specifically the widely-used Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model (DICE), represent the cost of emissions abatement. Many assume temporal independence---that abatement costs in one period are not affected by prior abatement. We contrast this with three dimensions of dynamic realism in emitting systems: (i) inertia, (ii) induced innovation, and (iii) path dependence. We review key evidence from the last quarter century on each of these three components. Studies of stock lifetime, dynamics of diffusion and past transitions suggest typical transition timescales of at least 20--40 years for the bulk emitting systems. The evidence that substantial innovation is induced by both prices and market deployment is unambiguous. Finally, both data and a rapidly growing literature demonstrate substantial path dependence in general, and specifically ``carbon lock-in and lock-out.'' Some stylized models in the past decade have incorporated technology learning, and others have considered inertia, but the combination of these factors is important and not yet evident. More complex hybrid IAMs with technology-rich energy-system models incorporate these factors, but their complexity has limited the wider understanding and influence of their underlying insights. Few if any global models fully represent path dependence. We conclude with likely implications drawing upon the empirical and modeling evidence accumulated, including results from extending DICE with a highly stylized representation of such dynamic factors. This suggests that dynamic interdependencies could multiply several-fold the optimal level of initial abatement expenditure. This is because early abatement then also directly facilitates subsequent emission savings. The diversity of dynamic linkages across sectors and technologies also implies more nuanced policy than a single global carbon price. Thus, the issues explored in this review can radically change the general policy conclusions drawn from models, which, like DICE, neglect dynamic realism.

  abstract = {Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) projects aim to contribute to climate change mitigation by protecting and enhancing carbon stocks in tropical forests, but there have been no systematic global evaluations of their impact. We used a new data set for tropical humid forests and a standardized evaluation approach (based on pixel matching) to quantify the performance of a representative sample of 40 voluntary REDD+ projects in 9 countries certified under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). In the first 5 years of implementation, deforestation within project areas was reduced by 47\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 24--68) compared with matched counterfactual pixels, and degradation rates were 58\% lower (95\% CI: 49--63). Reductions were small in absolute terms but greater in sites located in high-deforestation settings and did not appear to be substantially undermined by leakage activities in forested areas within 10 km of project boundaries. At the 26th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international community renewed its commitment to tackling tropical deforestation as a nature-based solution to climate change. Our results indicate that incentivizing forest conservation through voluntary site-based projects can slow tropical deforestation and highlight the particular importance of prioritizing financing for areas at greater risk of deforestation.},

  abstract = {Water is vital to the mining industry; mines can require substantial amounts of water and are often located in some of the driest places on earth. Reducing water withdrawals and improving mine water use are key strategic requirements for moving toward a more sustainable mining industry. Mine water requirements often have significant technical, economic, environmental and political implications. This thesis quantifies global mine water withdrawals and discusses methods of improving mine water use by reducing water withdrawals and water-related energy consumption. The thesis is composed of four main sections. First, two methods are proposed to calculate global mining water withdrawals by commodity. One method is based on the amount of water required to process a tonne of ore and the other is based on the amount of water required to produce a tonne of concentrate. A large database was created, compiling data regarding ore production, commodity production, commodity prices, and mine water withdrawals between 2006 and 2009. The study estimates that global water withdrawals range from 6 to 8 billion m3 per annum. Second, the thesis presents a case study on the challenges faced and lessons learned during the design, start-up and modification of the water systems of a large copper mine site. Third, the thesis identifies multiple mine water reduction, reuse and recycle strategies that have been implemented around the world. A model is developed and used to show the potential impact of these strategies. The results of the modelling show how a hypothetical mine could reduce water withdrawals from 0.76 m3/t to 0.20 m3/t of ore processed or lower. In particular, the combination of ore pre-concentration and filtered tailings disposal reduced water consumption by over 74\% of the base case. Finally, this thesis describes and demonstrates a method of determining the lowest energy option for a mine water network. The method uses a linear programming algorithm to compare options for matching water sources with consumers at mine sites. An example illustrates the method and shows how mine water system energy requirements can be reduced by over 50\%.},

Our econometric analysis implies that the perceived financial performance of SRI matters for the shares of investments in SRI among all investments. However, our main result is that psychological motives, values, and norms like warm glow motives and expectations of the social environment are even more relevant and thus have strong significant effects on SRI. This suggests that SRI investors gain strong non-financial utility from sustainable investments. While the membership in Christian churches and the strength of Christian religiosity also seem to be positively correlated with SRI, these correlations become insignificant if other psychological motives, values, and norms are included in the econometric analysis. Furthermore, a left-wing political orientation rather has significant negative effects on SRI. An explanation for this surprising result is the general aversion of a left-wing identification to the participation in stock markets, which is dominant in SRI.},

(ii) We analyze to what extent sustainability or transparency labels can help to overcome these barriers. To this end, we empirically analyze data from a survey and a stated choice experiment for a broad sample of financial decision makers in German households. The results suggest that a considerable amount of respondents can imagine to invest in a socially responsible manner, which is promising for policymakers and practitioners who aim to foster sustainable development and SRI. However, too high information costs are a severe barrier for potential future investors and a considerable share of respondents distrusts providers of socially responsible investment products. Banks, who could help to solve this problem, appear not to fulfill their role as intermediaries. But we find that labels might serve as a complement to banks. Especially sustainability certificates that confirm the consideration of sustainability criteria could decrease information costs and overcome at least some barriers for some investor groups, particularly for new investors. However, the results also suggest that a certain degree of basic knowledge and trust in providers of socially responsible investment products is required before labels work efficiently.},

Our study confirms that policy uncertainty and short-termism in the financial system are the two main investment barriers. Our results show that identified barriers form a complex system characterised by path-dependency, lock-in and non-linearity. We recommend the adoption of systems theory as an analytical framework to inform the related policy debate and propose the expansion or development of sustainable investment vehicles as a useful near-term solution while preparing a long-term policy intervention based on a systems perspective.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. The paper analyzes how adaptability (adaptive capacity and adaptations) is constructed in the literature on resilience of social--ecological systems (SES). According to some critics, this literature views adaptability as the capacity of SES to self-organize in an autonomous harmonious consensus-building process, ignoring strategies, conflicting goals, and power issues. We assessed 183 papers, coding two dimensions of adaptability: autonomous vs. intentional and descriptive vs. normative. We found a plurality of framings, where 51\% of the papers perceived adaptability as autonomous, but one-third constructed adaptability as intentional processes driven by stakeholders; where social learning and networking are often used as strategies for changing power structures and achieving sustainability transformations. For the other dimension, adaptability was used normatively in 59\% of the assessed papers, but one-third used descriptive framings. We found no evidence that the SES literature in general assumes a priori that adaptations are harmonious consensus-building processes. It is, rather, conflicts that are assumed, not spelled out, and assertions of ``desirable'' that are often not clarified by reference to policy documents or explicit normative frameworks. We discuss alternative definitions of adaptability and transformability to clarify or avoid the notion of desirability. Complex adaptive systems framing often precludes analysis of agency, but lately self-organization and emergence have been used to study actors with intentions, strategies, and conflicting interests. Transformations and power structures are increasingly being addressed in the SES literature. We conclude that ontological clashes between social science and SES research have resulted in multiple constructive pathways.},

We find that most of the research so far has only considered one-directional effects of inequality on the biosphere, or vice versa. However, given the potential for complex dynamics between socioeconomic and environmental factors within social-ecological systems, we highlight examples from the literature that illustrate the importance of cross-scale interactions and feedback loops between inequality and the biosphere. This review draws on diverse disciplines to advance a systemic understanding of the linkages between inequality and the biosphere, specifically recognizing cross-scale feedbacks and the multidimensional nature of inequality.},

Drawing motivation from other issue areas in international relations ranging from nuclear non-proliferation, transboundary air pollution and liberalized trade, we use an evolutionary-game-theoretic model to analyze regimes that yield domestic incentives to contribute to public goods provision (co-benefits). Co-benefits may be limited, but can create a nucleus for formation of coalitions that grow while deepening provision of global public goods. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) is a prime example of an agreement that employs partially excludable club benefits to deepen cooperation on non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Our game-theoretic results support two important insights for the building blocks approach to addressing climate change: sustained cooperation in club agreements is possible even when public goods are not entirely excludable and some members of the population free-ride; and second, cooperation in small club configurations yields larger non-excludable public goods benefits than cooperation in more inclusive forums.

  abstract = {Ferroalloys are defined as iron-bearing alloys with a high proportion of one or more other elements - manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, etc., mainly used by the iron and steel industries. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of a number of these ferroalloy production processes. The results of the study showed that GHG footprint for ferroalloy production in Australia was 1.8 t CO 2e/t FeMn, 2.8 t CO 2e/t SiMn and 3.4 t CO 2e/t FeSi alloy metal. These results compare with GHG footprints for ferronickel and ferrochromium of 13.9 t CO 2e/t and 3.0 t CO 2e/t, respectively revised from an earlier study. These GHG footprint estimates were calculated using the Tasmanian electricity greenhouse gas emission factor since these ferroalloy industries are located in Tasmania, Australia. The major difference in greenhouse gas emissions between the various ferroalloys is largely due to their respective amounts of electricity use and coke/coal consumption. These results are not too different to the results from a limited number of studies reported in the literature when compared on a similar electricity source basis. The LCA results also showed that coke and coal usage contributed close to 60\% or more of the total GHG emissions from the various ferroalloy production processes. In light of this finding, there would appear to be an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions from ferroalloy production if fossil fuel-based coal is replaced with biomass based renewable carbon. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment considers both the direct and indirect impact of a process or technology in the upstream process value chain. Energy can be produced from a variety of fuels or renewable sources. Thermal energy is delivered in the form of heat and the heat is often used to generate electricity or power. Thus the conventional use of energy for industrial or residential applications is either in the form of thermal heat or electricity. Generating energy from fossil fuel, such as coal and gas, produces a significant amount of greenhouse gas globally. Reducing greenhouse gas from energy systems is a significant challenge which requires the precise determination of both direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the extraction and processing of fuels using various unit processes along the different stages of the production chain. In the case of renewable energy, a life cycle analysis must consider the energy required for the mining, manufacturing of materials (e.g., wind turbines, solar panels, batteries), and the building of the infrastructure. In order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to compare and rank various energy technologies and optimize their emission contributions. This chapter introduces how life cycle assessment methodology can be applied to energy systems and how this can aid in making decisions on selecting appropriate technologies for a given scenario.},

  abstract = {The environmental benefits of low-carbon technologies, such as photovoltaic modules, have been under debate because their large-scale deployment will require a drastic increase in metal production. This is of concern because higher metal demand may induce ore grade decline and can thereby further intensify the environmental footprint of metal supply. To account for this interlinkage known as the ``energy-resource nexus'', energy and metal supply scenarios need to be assessed in conjunction. We investigate the trends of future impacts of metal supplies and low-carbon technologies, considering both metal and electricity supply scenarios. We develop metal supply scenarios for copper, nickel, zinc, and lead, extending previous work. Our scenarios consider developments such as ore grade decline, energy-efficiency improvements, and secondary production shares. We also include two future electricity supply scenarios from the IMAGE model using a recently published methodology. Both scenarios are incorporated into the background database of ecoinvent to realize an integrated modeling approach, that is, future metal supply chains make use of future electricity and vice versa. We find that impacts of the modeled metal supplies and low-carbon technologies may decrease in the future. Key drivers for impact reductions are the electricity transition and increasing secondary production shares. Considering both metal and electricity scenarios has proven valuable because they drive impact reductions in different categories, namely human toxicity (up to -43\%) and climate change (up to -63\%), respectively. Thus, compensating for lower ore grades and reducing impacts beyond climate change requires both greener electricity and also sustainable metal supply.

We show empirically that a reduction in financing costs for firms that are already green leads to small improvements in impact at best. In contrast, increasing financing costs for brown firms leads to large negative changes in firm impact. Thus, sustainable investing that directs capital away from brown firms and toward green firms may be counterproductive, in that it makes brown firms more brown without making green firms more green. We further show that brown firms face very weak financial incentives to become more green. Due to a mistaken focus on percentage reductions in emissions, the sustainable investing movement primarily rewards green firms for economically trivial reductions in their already low levels of emissions.},

In this regard, the indicators were clustered based on their respective sustainability dimensions (i.e. economy, social, and environment). Pareto charts were developed for the analysis process. The most frequent sustainability indicators can be determined based on Pareto 80-20 rule. Results of the analysis showed that from an initial 63 sustainability indicators, 32 indicators were listed as highly influential sustainability indicators.

Yet, decisions regarding resource use and emissions are mostly made at less aggregated scales, by national and sub-national governments, businesses, and other local actors. To operationalize the planetary boundaries concept, the boundaries need to be translated into and aligned with targets that are relevant at these decision-making scales. In this paper, we develop a framework that addresses the biophysical, socio-economic, and ethical dimensions of bridging across scales, to provide a consistently applicable approach for translating the planetary boundaries into national-level fair shares of Earth's safe operating space. We discuss our findings in the context of previous studies and their implications for future analyses and policymaking. In this way, we link the planetary boundaries framework to widely-applied operational and policy concepts for more robust strong sustainability decision-making.},

Past policies and current commitments indicate that many of these forests will be plantations. Since plantations often replace more carbon-rich or biodiverse land covers, this approach to forest expansion may undermine objectives of increased carbon storage and biodiversity. We use an econometric land use change model to simulate the carbon and biodiversity impacts of subsidy driven plantation expansion in Chile between 1986 and 2011. A comparison of simulations with and without subsidies indicates that payments for afforestation increased tree cover through expansion of plantations of exotic species but decreased the area of native forests. Chile's forest subsidies probably decreased biodiversity without increasing total carbon stored in aboveground biomass. Carefully enforced safeguards on the conversion of natural ecosystems can improve both the carbon and biodiversity outcomes of reforestation policies.},

The purpose of the study is to explore the current gap between supply and demand of sustainable financial investments in German retail banking from a financial advisor's point of view. We use qualitative analysis of interviews with financial advisors based on a Grounded Theory approach with the aim to identify the key causation in the cause-effect relationship of the supply-demand-discrepancy. Our findings yield two explanations of the discrepancy. First, investment advisors attribute responsibility towards private investors, i.e., they ask for a clear signal whether private investors are interested in sustainable investment. Thereby, we refer to causal and responsibility attribution theory for grasping this phenomenon. Second, investors are risk-averse and therefore reluctant to invest in stocks, which represent the common form of sustainable investment in Germany. Accordingly, we propose risk averseness as a variable moderating the relationship between demand and supply of sustainable investment products within the frame of attribution theory. The study contributes towards the state-of-the-art by proposing an explanation for the mechanisms underlying the advisor-customer-relationship in the context of predominant risk-averse investment culture that currently hamper the expansion of the Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) segment of private investors in Germany. This paper outlines measures for promoting sustainable financial products in Germany, namely, among others, the creation of a more customizable offering of SRI products and the importance to inform customers about sustainable investment opportunities by advisors and banks.},

  abstract = {In the modern economy, international value chains - production, use, and disposal of goods - have global environmental impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) aims to track these impacts and assess them from a systems perspective, identifying strategies for improvement without burden shifting. We review recent developments in LCA, including existing and emerging applications aimed at supporting environmentally informed decisions in policy-making, product development and procurement, and consumer choices. LCA constitutes a viable screening tool that can pinpoint environmental hotspots in complex value chains, but we also caution that completeness in scope comes at the price of simplifications and uncertainties. Future advances of LCA in enhancing regional detail and accuracy as well as broadening the assessment to economic and social aspects will make it more relevant for producers and consumers alike.},

  abstract = {Climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution-the triple planetary crisis-increasingly threaten the Earth system, necessitating tools such as life-cycle assessment (LCA) that can evaluate the effectiveness of different prevention and mitigation strategies. LCA systematically quantifies the environmental impacts over the whole life cycle of products, processes or policy scenarios. LCA is frequently applied to uncover environmental hotspots and prioritize actions and is increasingly used to assess the environmental impacts of strategy implementation scenarios. In this Review, we discuss the role of LCA in evaluating and shaping strategies on the decarbonization of energy systems, circular economy, sustainable consumption and sustainable finance. We explore how emerging LCA-based approaches make use of the planetary boundaries framework and other environmental assessment tools to support decisions. Cross-comparisons between LCA applications for various mitigation strategies reveal differences in maturity level, methodological choices and the way that environmental assessment tools have been combined with LCA. Economy-wide LCAs on the decarbonization of energy systems and sustainable consumption are already common, whereas economy-wide applications to circular economy and prospective LCAs for sustainable finance are still in their infancy. Future research should develop systematic classification of decision-support problems, harmonized data and comprehensive guidance to improve robustness and credibility of prospective economy-wide LCA.},

The software thus especially serves the rapidly growing field of strategic interaction research within psychology and behavioral economics. In contrast to all available software packages, our platform does not handle stimulus display and response collection itself. Instead, we provide a mechanism to extend existing experimental software to incorporate interactive functionality. This approach allows us to draw upon the capabilities already available, such as accuracy of temporal measurement, integration with auxiliary hardware such as eye-trackers or (neuro-)physiological apparatus, and recent advances in experimental software, for example capturing response dynamics through mouse-tracking. Through integration with OpenSesame, an open-source graphical experiment builder, studies can be assembled via a drag-and-drop interface requiring little or no further programming skills. In addition, by using the same communication mechanism across software packages, we also enable interoperability between systems. Our source code, which provides support for all major operating systems and several popular experimental packages, can be freely used and distributed under an open source license. The communication protocols underlying its functionality are also well documented and easily adapted to further platforms. Code and documentation are available at                    https://github.com/psynteract/                                    .},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Does technological innovation to improve the efficiency of energy-using products and systems lead to lower energy consumption and hence reduced environmental impacts? The answer given by economists since the mid-19th century is `no'. This is because there are direct `rebound' or `take-back' effects caused by energy efficiency improvements that lower the implicit price of energy, often leading to greater consumption. Also there are secondary or indirect effects of reducing energy costs through efficiency in that consumers may buy more products and/or choose, larger, more powerful, more feature laden models. Thus just promoting technical innovation to increase energy efficiency is unlikely to lead to reduced energy consumption and emissions. Other policies such as taxation or regulation are required. As well as setting the theoretical arguments concerning innovation and energy efficiency the paper outlines results from an empirical research project, `People-centred eco-design', which seeks to identify the key influencing factors on consumer adoption and effective use of energy efficient products and systems. In particular it aims to identify how consumers may avoid (or mitigate) rebound effects and how manufacturers, service providers and government might design and promote such products to achieve their optimal environmental benefits.},

Such phenomena include asset and security market booms and crashes; real investment booms and busts; takeover and financing waves; shifts in disclosure practices, such as the use of pro forma earnings disclosures and financial market runs. Often the behaviors of relevant participants converge despite negative payoff externalities, suggesting that such patterns may be caused by contagious effects of psychological bias or by the failure of rational social learning to aggregate information efficiently. Furthermore, transaction costs, minimum trade sizes, or psychological biases can prevent price from fully aggregating information. As a result, proper trading cascades can form, including cascades in participation versus nonparticipation in markets. Even without frictions or biases, information cascades in investigation indirectly affect trading and the amount of information aggregated into market price. Therefore, despite some arguments to the contrary, in several economic settings information cascades affect securities trading and prices. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Shifting the focus away from the level of individual morals and choices, this paper sets out to trace the discursive "conditions of possibility" for reflective and responsible financial consumption. Through a critical discourse analysis of media and marketing texts, the paper identifies and examines four conventionalized discourses of stock market investing: market mechanics, market psychology, market participation, and market expertise. The paper shows how each of these widely normalized discourses articulates investing as an individual enterprise of wealth management, devoid of broader social or political relevance. It is argued that the prevalence of such representations is likely to discourage social awareness with regard to financial consumption and to impede the establishment of fair and sustainable market practices. {\copyright} 2011 Taylor \& Francis.},

Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences. {\copyright} The Author 2007.

Companies are central to the effort to grapple with these issues due to the large material flows they process and their capabilities for technological innovation. It is important, on the one hand, to determine the individual stake companies have in these issues and, on the other, to measure companies' performance. Since the results of studies thus far have been ambiguous, we define four comprehensive and systematic corporate carbon performance indicators: (1) Carbon intensity is physically oriented and represents a company's carbon use in relation to a business metric. (2) Carbon dependency illustrates the change in physical carbon performance within a given time period. (3) Carbon exposure reveals the financial implications of using and emitting carbon. (4) Carbon risk estimates the change in financial implications of carbon usage within a given time period. On the basis of these general definitions, we specify the indicators for a standardized application that can support two important stakeholders in their decision making: policy makers, who can include such information when evaluating current climate policies and formulating future ones, and investors and financial institutions, which can compare companies with respect to their carbon performance and corresponding financial effects.},

  abstract = {As moral decision making in financial markets incorporates moral considerations into investment decisions, some rational decision theorists argue that moral considerations would introduce inefficiency to investment decisions. However, market demand for socially responsible investment is increasing, suggesting that investment decisions are influenced by both financial and moral considerations. Several models can be applied to explain moral behavior. We test the suitability of (a) multiple attribute utility theory (MAUT), (b) theory of planned behavior, and (c) issue-contingent model of ethical decision making in organizations. In an experimental setting, 141 participants traded company shares in a computerized asset market. Over 12 periods, companies varied in morality (i.e., treatment of employees) and in profitability (i.e., expected dividends per share). Participants' bids and asks for shares were recorded. Results indicate that moral considerations influence investment decisions, controlling for profit. Differences between the three models are discussed. {\copyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate financing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the US also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Purpose: Lead is one of the most commonly used metals in the past millennium because of its various properties. Moreover, lead is easy to extract and handle. However, the lead industry often encounters strong public opposition because of lead poisoning. This study analyzes the economic and environmental impacts of lead in China, which is the world's largest producer and consumer of lead. Methods: Life cycle assessment coupled with life cycle costing was conducted to estimate the environmental and economic impacts of primary and secondary lead refining in China. The internal cost (i.e., raw materials and energy consumption, labor, tax, interest, transport, infrastructure, depreciation, and maintenance) and external market price (i.e., carbon, ammonia, arsenic, COD, lead, mercury, nitrogen oxides, particulates, sulfur dioxide, and land eco-remediation) are considered. Results and discussion: The overall environmental burden was mainly generated from the human toxicity and marine ecotoxicity categories for both primary and secondary lead refining scenarios because of the direct lead emission in the air and water. For the primary lead refining, the effect on metal depletion represented an additional dominant contribution to the overall environmental burden. The overall economic impact was mainly attributed to lead ore or waste lead, tax, labor fee, and emission cost of ammonia and chromium. In 2013, approximately 5.61~Mt CO2 eq, 5.81~Mt 1,4-DB eq, 6.59~kt 1,4-DB eq, 7.86~kt 1,4-DB eq, 1.82~Mt{$\cdot$}kg Fe eq, 2.37~Mt{$\cdot$}kg oil eq, and \$9.9 billion were recorded from the lead industry in China in the climate change, human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, metal depletion, fossil depletion, and economic impact categories, respectively. Additionally, approximately 0.4~kt lead, 18.4~kt sulfur dioxide, 15.6~kt nitrogen oxide, and 6.4~kt particulate emissions in the same year were released from the lead industry in China. Conclusions: Approximately 57 to 96~\% environmental benefits through waste lead recycling in all key categories were observed, whereas its economic benefit was low. The key factors that contribute in reducing the overall environmental and economic impacts include reducing direct lead emissions in air and water, increasing the national recycling rate of lead, replacing coal with clean energy sources for electricity production, improving heavy metal-removing technologies from mining wastewater, and optimizing the efficiency of electricity, lead ore, coal, oxygen, natural gas, and sodium carbonate consumption.},

Overshoot of the earth's natural resource bases militates against our current and future prospects for sustainability. Despite the theoretical and practical impetus to examine these dynamics, there is a dearth of empirical sociological research that analyzes overshoot. The paper fills this gap by offering a structural equation model of each nation's relative contributions to overshoot. The model tests key theorizations in the environmental sociology, development, and global political-economy literatures, and adds to them by theorizing and empirically testing ecofeminist positions that the status of women affects and is affected by environmental conditions. Findings support ecofeminist interpretations that resource degradation yields adverse impacts on women and that their representation in government bodes well for the environment. The theoretical, empirical, and policy-based conclusions and implications are treated, as well as future areas of research.},

Further analysis shows that green insurance can enhance a firm's environmental performance by promoting green innovation.

  abstract = {Purpose: Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) translates emissions and resource extractions into a limited number of environmental impact scores by means of so-called characterisation factors. There are two mainstream ways to derive characterisation factors, i.e. at midpoint level and at endpoint level. To further progress LCIA method development, we updated the ReCiPe2008 method to its version of 2016. This paper provides an overview of the key elements of the ReCiPe2016 method. Methods: We implemented human health, ecosystem quality and resource scarcity as three areas of protection. Endpoint characterisation factors, directly related to the areas of protection, were derived from midpoint characterisation factors with a constant mid-to-endpoint factor per impact category. We included 17 midpoint impact categories. Results and discussion: The update of ReCiPe provides characterisation factors that are representative for the global scale instead of the European scale, while maintaining the possibility for a number of impact categories to implement characterisation factors at a country and continental scale. We also expanded the number of environmental interventions and added impacts of water use on human health, impacts of water use and climate change on freshwater ecosystems and impacts of water use and tropospheric ozone formation on terrestrial ecosystems as novel damage pathways. Although significant effort has been put into the update of ReCiPe, there is still major improvement potential in the way impact pathways are modelled. Further improvements relate to a regionalisation of more impact categories, moving from local to global species extinction and adding more impact pathways. Conclusions: Life cycle impact assessment is a fast evolving field of research. ReCiPe2016 provides a state-of-the-art method to convert life cycle inventories to a limited number of life cycle impact scores on midpoint and endpoint level.},

International political disagreements on the distribution of the world's natural, financial and technological resources and on global social inequalities are now enmeshed with international forest and climate politics. The paper discusses two variants of an international AD; carbon trading and ODA. It then explores some of the political controversies that are likely to arise when agreeing the fine details of an international mechanism for AD.},

  abstract = {Finance is a precondition for many of the activities that harm ecosystems, but how to address this underlying driver of biodiversity loss remains a topic of debate. This paper reviews the Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a corporate-led effort that aims to identify how changes to biodiversity may create financial risks for companies and investors. This approach is also promoted as a strategy for managing the impact of business on biodiversity, with the assumption that risk disclosure will more effectively price biodiversity-harming activities. We assess the potential of the TNFD toward this end, and invite conservation scientists, practitioners, and policymakers to engage critically with its theory of change. We find that the relationship between disclosing biodiversity risk and redirecting finance away from environmental degradation is tenuous and unproven, making this mechanism insufficient for addressing the impact of the financial sector on nature. We question the embrace of another industry-led mechanism that implies that a lack of information is the greatest barrier to stopping biodiversity loss.

Such a computer-based method provides an array of medium-specific capabilities and technical benefits to improve sustainability communication, both for companies (reporters) and their various stakeholders (report users). Compared with orthodox methods, online reporting used for sustainability communication over-comes the limitations of paper-based disclosure, such as 'one size fits all' reports, print medium fixation and one-way communication. The contribution gives an outline on this up-and-coming sustainability online reporting approach in four categories. (i) Medium-specific trends in the field are observed. (ii) New opportunities emerging for corporate sustainability communication are identified. (iii) A framework for sustainability online reporting is presented. (iv) Limitations are discussed that should be considered when moving away from early reporting stages towards the advanced one of sustainability online reporting.

  abstract = {How is impact investing evaluated? How can and should it be evaluated? Over the past 5 years, there has been solid progress in developing social impact metrics at the industry-wide, firm and investment levels and the industry is becoming increasingly data-rich. Nevertheless, evaluation practices still tend to focus on counting inputs and outputs, and telling stories. Moreover, an important element is too often underdeveloped, invisible, not explicit or missing altogether. That element is theory of change, an approach and tool drawn from the field of program evaluation. This article reviews cases where theory of change has, in fact, been used to good effect at various levels of the impact investing industry. It also discusses a range of qualitative and quantitative methods which could be usefully blended with the theory of change approach, and affirms the equally important imperatives of accountability and learning across all combinations of methods. The article concludes that a more comprehensive application of theory of change to all levels of the field is required -- and especially to the micro-level of individuals, households and communities, where the results of impact investments matter most. Such an approach can help build an impact investing industry that is adaptive, transparent and self-sustaining. To this end, creating an ongoing dialogue between the development evaluation field and the impact investing industry, and designing and launching new education and training initiatives, are key tasks in the years ahead.},

In total, 60 employees from 19 investment institutions, 453 private investors and 71 institutional investors participated in a questionnaire study. While socially responsible investment (SRI) among private and institutional investors was guided by self-transcendent values (environmental and social values), this was not the case among fund managers working in investment institutions. Fund managers in investment institutions were affected by beliefs about long-term returns of SRI. Private investors were, in addition, influenced by beliefs about long-term returns, whereas institutional investors were motivated by an effort to reduce financial risks. Finally, investment institutions tended to overrate the importance of financial returns among their beneficiaries (private and institutional beneficiaries) and underestimate the importance of ethical, environmental and social aspects for beneficiaries. The results indicate that private and institutional investors/beneficiaries give a wider interpretation of fiduciary duty than investment institutions do. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.},

Based on an instrument that captures concepts in the Value-Belief-Norm theory, and potential financial beliefs that may influence the SRI intentions of investors, a survey was addressed to all major Swedish investments institutions. Fifty-eight respondents from 17 different investment institutions participated in the survey of whom 31 were conventional (non-SRI) investors and 27 were socially responsible investors. Our results show that conventional and SRI investors share similar beliefs about short-term and long-term performance on SRI investments in that SRI gives less return in the short term but slightly more than conventional investments in the longer term. However, SRI investors express significantly more interest in increasing their future SRI investments than conventional investors do. We discover that future SRI is not influenced by social and environmental concerns. Rather, financial beliefs about risk and beliefs about increased market shares drive SRI forward. The business case for SRI seems therefore to be the only reason for major investment institutions to adopt SRI. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

Insurance is also often described as a positive factor in coastal risk reduction if insurers proactively reward homeowners for upgrades that mitigate losses from hurricanes. The empirical and policy-relevant question remains whether homeowners perceive insurance incentives as perverse or positive. A new survey of 662 North Carolina coastal homeowners shows that most are failing to upgrade their homes to address hurricane risk or plan for coastal retreat but not because they expect insurance to cover losses. Rather those aware of insurance incentives are more likely to live in better-protected residences and take the incentivized actions. Limited awareness of existing policies suggests a need for greater outreach by policymakers, lenders, and insurers.

This highlights the significance of reliable, integrated information for guiding and assessing actions and policies aimed at managing and sustaining the many functions and benefits of species. Here we synthesize the types of data and approaches that are required to achieve such an integration and conceptualize `essential biodiversity variables' (EBVs) for a unified global capture of species populations in space and time. The inherent heterogeneity and sparseness of raw biodiversity data are overcome by the use of models and remotely sensed covariates to inform predictions that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We define the species population EBVs as a space--time--species--gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its resolution adjusted to represent available evidence and acceptable levels of uncertainty. This essential information enables the monitoring of single or aggregate spatial or taxonomic units at scales relevant to research and decision-making. When combined with ancillary environmental or species data, this fundamental species population information directly underpins a range of biodiversity and ecosystem function indicators. The unified concept we present links disparate data to downstream uses and informs a vision for species population monitoring in which data collection is closely integrated with models and infrastructure to support effective biodiversity assessment.},

The public concern is that firms may misuse this exemption rule to hide non-proprietary environmental information. Examining the mandatory chemical disclosure program in the fracking industry, I find evidence of opportunistic withholding of information among operators that are less likely to have trade secrets. Specifically, I focus on within-operator variation and show that operators hide fewer chemicals as trade secrets when the operating site is in close proximity to water quality monitors. Further analyses suggest that operators are concerned about external environmental monitoring, which deters them from opportunistic information withholding. I find limited evidence of such opportunistic behavior among operators that are more likely to have trade secrets. This paper presents the first empirical evidence that firms may use trade secret exemption as an avoidance strategy in mandatory environmental disclosure programs.},

Average performance is significantly lower but more persistent when these conclusions are inferred from the aggregate database than from some of the individual commercial databases. Although hedge funds deliver performance persistence, the average fund does not deliver significant risk-adjusted net-of-fee returns while the gross-of-fee returns remain significantly positive. Consistent with previous literature, we find a significant association between fund characteristics related to share restrictions as well as compensation structure and risk-adjusted returns.},

Here, we develop a local-to-global, and global-to-local, earth-economy model that integrates the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)-computable general equilibrium model of the economy with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model of fine-scale, spatially explicit ecosystem services. The integrated model, GTAP--InVEST, jointly determines land use, environmental conditions, ecosystem services, market prices, supply and demand across economic sectors, trade across regions, and aggregate performance metrics like GDP. We use the integrated model to analyze the contribution of investing in nature for economic prosperity, accounting for the impact of four important ecosystem services (pollination, timber provision, marine fisheries, and carbon sequestration). We show that investments in nature result in large improvements relative to a business-as-usual path, accruing annual gains of \$100 to \$350 billion (2014 USD) with the largest percentage gains in the lowest-income countries. Our estimates include only a small subset of ecosystem services and could be far higher with inclusion of more ecosystem services, incorporation of ecological tipping points, and reduction in substitutability that limits economic adjustments to declines in natural capital. Our analysis highlights the need for improved environmental--economic modeling and the vital importance of integrating environmental information firmly into economic analysis and policy. The benefits of doing so are potentially very large, with the greatest percentage benefits accruing to inhabitants of the poorest countries.},

  abstract = {We provide a detailed holdings-based analysis of investment decisions made by U.S. equity SRI funds. Besides incorporating conventional fundamental factors, such as earnings growth, leverage, dividend yield, stock return and volatility, SRI funds adjust portfolio weights by considering companies' relative ESG performance. This holds for all categories of passively and actively managed funds, while for active funds ESG scores have a higher economic impact for value rather than growth funds. The timing of inclusion of companies in active SRI funds or their exclusion is driven primarily by fundamentals rather than by ESG performance. We find that both active SRI and matched conventional funds integrate ESG information as well as financial criteria in their investment decisions, but SRI portfolios exhibit higher average sustainability scores. Finally, we posit that SRI screening criteria effectively guide investment decisions, positive screening resulting in higher active portfolio weights of best performers in a corresponding ESG pillar.},

The Sentinel 2 satellites, first launched in mid-2015, are excellent candidates for LULC mapping due to their high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Advances in deep learning and scalable cloud-based compute now provide the analysis capability required to unlock the value in global satellite imagery observations. Based on a novel, very large dataset of over 5 billion human-labeled Sentinel-2 pixels, we developed and deployed a deep learning segmentation model on Sentinel-2 data to create a global LULC map at 10m resolution that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and enables automated LULC mapping from time series observations.},

The main investment drivers were compared in an integrated action model involving elements of the theory of planned behavior and the norm-activation model, i.e., investment intentions, attitudes, personal (ecological) and social norms, and perceived behavioral control. For each group, different models were calculated in order to investigate the relevance of different types of social norms within the decision process, i.e., injunctive or descriptive norms. As expected, the household and organizational decisions were found to be based on different key factors: the decision makers in households mostly considered personal and descriptive social norms; the organizational decisions were mostly grounded in attitudes and injunctive social norms concerning staff expectations. The results suggest the need for tailored policy measures for each target group.},

  abstract = {Financial risks related to climate change and biodiversity loss are currently being addressed in a largely siloed manner. Neglecting their interconnections, however, may lead to `blind spots' and misestimations of systemic financial risk, potentially undermining progress on both climate finance policy and emerging policy on biodiversity-related financial risks (BRFR). In particular, the `risk measurement--based' approach dominating climate finance policy, which is now being taken up to address BRFR, is poorly equipped to address the radical uncertainty that characterises both types of risks. Furthermore, many BRFR may materalise over a more immediate horizon than climate risks. In this paper, we examine how central banks and financial supervisors are approaching the topic of BRFR in relation to climate-related financial risk. We argue that policymakers should focus upon the broader concept of systemic environmental-financial risks to account for the interactions and trade-offs between both domains of biodiversity and climate change. Instead of seeking evidence of financial materiality before acting, focusing on how the financial system is actively facilitating direct drivers of environmental damage offers a way for financial policymakers to assess potential sources of such risks on the basis of information available today. In turn, policy interventions should aim to reduce harmful flows of finance that may lead to the crossing of dangerous ecological tipping points. Financial policymakers need to think beyond siloes, and act on a precautionary basis to manage climate- and biodiversity-related financial risks concurrently.Financial authorities, coordinating with relevant government departments, should define business activities that are most harmful to climate and biodiversity, especially those contributing to ecological tipping points, e.g. activities linked to tropical deforestation, which will damage both domains.To aid transparency and supervisory risk assessment, financial supervisors could require the mandatory disclosure of portfolio composition, risk management, and due diligence procedures relating to the financing of identified harmful activities.Financial regulators could use their toolkits to discourage the financing of such activities, e.g. by applying punitive capital requirements.This approach may require greater coordination between central banks and other government departments to maintain democratic legitimacy and support existing central bank mandates.

  abstract = {Forecasts by economists of the economic damage from climate change have been notably sanguine, compared to warnings by scientists about damage to the biosphere. This is because economists made their own predictions of damages, using three spurious methods: assuming that about 90\% of GDP will be unaffected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the impact of global warming over time; and using surveys that diluted extreme warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists. Nordhaus has misrepresented the scientific literature to justify the using a smooth function to describe the damage to GDP from climate change. Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human civilization.},

Due to their central role in the recent IPCC assessments, and international climate policy analyses more generally, and the high uncertainties related to future projections, IAMs have been critically assessed by scholars from different fields receiving various critiques ranging from adequacy of their methods to how their results are used and communicated. Although IAMs are conceptually diverse and evolved in very different directions, they tend to be criticised under the umbrella of `IAMs'. Here we first briefly summarise the IAM landscape and how models differ from each other. We then proceed to discuss six prominent critiques emerging from the recent literature, reflect and respond to them in the light of IAM diversity and ongoing work and suggest ways forward. The six critiques relate to (a) representation of heterogeneous actors in the models, (b) modelling of technology diffusion and dynamics, (c) representation of capital markets, (d) energy-economy feedbacks, (e) policy scenarios, and (f) interpretation and use of model results.},

  abstract = {An ecosystem service is a benefit derived by humanity that can be traced back to an ecological process. Although ecosystem services related to surface water have been thoroughly described, the relationship between atmospheric water and ecosystem services has been mostly neglected, and perhaps misunderstood. Recent advances in land-atmosphere modeling have revealed the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for moisture recycling. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which vegetation sustains the supply of atmospheric moisture and precipitation for downwind beneficiaries, globally. We simulate land-surface evaporation with a global hydrology model and track changes to moisture recycling using an atmospheric moisture budget model, and we define vegetation-regulated moisture recycling as the difference in moisture recycling between current vegetation and a hypothetical desert world. Our results show that nearly a fifth of annual average precipitation falling on land is from vegetation-regulated moisture recycling, but the global variability is large, with many places receiving nearly half their precipitation from this ecosystem service. The largest potential impacts for changes to this ecosystem service are land-use changes across temperate regions in North America and Russia. Likewise, in semi-arid regions reliant on rainfed agricultural production, land-use change that even modestly reduces evaporation and subsequent precipitation, could significantly affect human well-being. We also present a regional case study in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, where we identify the specific moisture recycling ecosystem services associated with the vegetation in Mato Grosso. We find that Mato Grosso vegetation regulates some internal precipitation, with a diffuse region of benefit downwind, primarily to the south and east, including the La Plata River basin and the megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We synthesize our global and regional results into a generalized framework for describing moisture recycling as an ecosystem service. We conclude that future work ought to disentangle whether and how this vegetation-regulated moisture recycling interacts with other ecosystem services, so that trade-offs can be assessed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner.},

This creates a bias towards solutions that ignore the new realities of the Anthropocene. We develop an integrated concept of what we denote Anthropocene risk---that is, risks that: emerge from human-driven processes; interact with global social--ecological connectivity; and exhibit complex, cross-scale relationships. To illustrate this, we use four cases: moisture recycling teleconnections, aquaculture and stranded assets, biome migration in the Sahel, and sea-level rise and megacities. We discuss the implications of Anthropocene risk across several research frontiers, particularly in the context of supranational power, environmental and social externalities and possible future Anthropocene risk governance. We conclude that decision makers must navigate this new epoch with new tools, and that Anthropocene risk contributes conceptual guidance towards a more sustainable and just future.},

  abstract = {Non-Technical SummaryHuman societies are changing where and how water flows through the atmosphere. However, these changes in the atmospheric water cycle are not being managed, nor is there any real sense of where these changes might be headed in the future. Thus, we develop a new economic theory of atmospheric water management, and explore this theory using creative story-based scenarios. These scenarios reveal surprising possibilities for the future of atmospheric water management, ranging from a stock market for transpiration to on-demand weather. We discuss these story-based futures in the context of research and policy priorities in the present day.Technical SummaryHumanity is modifying the atmospheric water cycle, via land use, climate change, air pollution, and weather modification. Historically, atmospheric water was implicitly considered a `public good' since it was neither actively consumed nor controlled. However, given anthropogenic changes, atmospheric water can become a `common-pool' good (consumable) or a `club' good (controllable). Moreover, advancements in weather modification presage water becoming a `private' good, meaning both consumable and controllable. Given the implications, we designed a theoretical framing of atmospheric water as an economic good and used a combination of methods in order to explore possible future scenarios based on human modifications of the atmospheric water cycle. First, a systematic literature search of scholarly abstracts was used in a computational text analysis. Second, the output of the text analysis was matched to different parts of an existing economic goods framework. Then, a group of global water experts were trained and developed story-based scenarios. The resultant scenarios serve as creative investigations of the future of human modification of the atmospheric water cycle. We discuss how the scenarios can enhance anticipatory capacity in the context of both future research frontiers and potential policy pathways including transboundary governance, finance, and resource management.Social Media SummaryStory-based scenarios reveal novel future pathways for the management of the atmospheric water cycle.},

The main goal was to quantify selected environmental impact categories and to compare and analyse each impact category for three different nickel feedstock for stainless steel production. The nickel laterite processing routes were (1) high pressure acid leaching (HPAL), (2) ferronickel, and (3) the newly developed Direct Nickel (DNi Process) that involves atmospheric leaching of nickel laterite using nitric acid. A cradle to gate approach was adopted. A functional unit of one tonne stainless steel was chosen. The scope covered was from laterite ore mining to final metal production. All inventory data was expressed in units per tonne nickel-based feedstock. The flow sheets for each technology were developed and the system boundaries were clearly defined. It was found that Ferronickel has the highest global warming potential and non-renewable energy scores whereas HPAL has the highest water depletion score. Overall, the DNi Process is found to be a more sustainable processing route as it produces less airborne emissions compared to the other two routes. Nitric acid is also less toxic compared to sulphuric acid used in HPAL. The DNi Process is also able to process different types of laterite ores (from limonitic to saprolitic ores) which is an important feature for future nickel production.},

  abstract = {To support the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the IPBES Expert Group on Scenarios and Models is carrying out an intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM). The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land-use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e., nature's contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) -- SSP1xRCP2.6, SSP3xRCP6.0, SSP5xRCP8.6 -- to explore a wide range of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the rationale for scenario selection, the process of harmonizing input data for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem services models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of this collaborative modeling project will support the ongoing global assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modeling processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its development of a post-2020 strategic plans and conservation goals, and inform the development of a new generation of nature-centred scenarios.},

Yet we know little about what this architecture looks like, why certain structures are observed, and how they are linked to the functioning of international institutions as well as the overall effectiveness of global governance. Over the past decade, network science has emerged as a promising and indispensable approach to unraveling structural nuances and complexities of the system of international institutions. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of this emerging field of research and seeks to stimulate its further development. In this article, I draw connections between various network analyses of global governance that are found in different bodies of literature. In so doing, I integrate three separate but overlapping strands of work on institutional fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity and bring much-needed conceptual clarity to the debate. Building on previous studies, I propose a framework for operationalizing fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity in network terms in order to enable systematic and comparative analysis of global governance systems. This article argues that there is much potential in the network approach and makes a case for advancing the ``network science of global governance.''},

The policy process should include a consideration of both timescales. The academy, however, has provided insufficient insight on the coevolution of social norms and different policy instruments, thus compromising the ability of decisionmakers to craft effective solutions to the society's most intractable environmental problems. Life scientists could make fundamental contributions to this agenda through targeted research on the emergence of social norms. {\copyright} 2013 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

  abstract = {Research on sustainability and transitions is burgeoning. Some of this research is helping to solve humankind's most pressing problems. However, as this provocation argues, up to 50\% of the articles that are now being published in many interdisciplinary sustainability and transitions journals may be categorized as ``scholarly bullshit.'' These are articles that typically engage with the latest sustainability and transitions buzzword (e.g., circular economy), while contributing little to none to the scholarly body of knowledge on the topic. A typology of ``scholarly bullshit'' is proposed which includes the following archetypes: boring question scholarship, literature review of literature reviews, recycled research, master thesis madness, and activist rants. Since ``scholarly bullshit'' articles engage with the latest academic buzzwords, they also tend to accumulate significant citations and are thus welcomed by many journal editors. Citations matter most in the metric-driven logic of the academic system, and this type of scholarship, sadly, is thus unlikely to decrease in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Concentrated solar power (CSP) is unique among intermittent renewable energy options because for the past four years, utility-scale plants have been using an energy storage technology that could allow a CSP plant to operate as a baseload renewable energy generator in the future. No study to-date has directly compared the environmental implications of this technology with more conventional CSP backup energy options. This study compares the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, and direct, onsite land use associated with one MW. h of electricity production from CSP plants with wet and dry cooling and with three energy backup systems: (1) minimal backup (MB), (2) molten salt thermal energy storage (TES), and (3) a natural gas-fired heat transfer fluid heater (NG). Plants with NG had 4-9 times more life cycle GHG emissions than plants with TES. Plants with TES generally had twice as many life cycle GHG emissions as the MB plants. Dry cooling reduced life cycle water consumption by 71-78\% compared to wet cooling. Plants with larger backup capacities had greater life cycle water consumption than plants with smaller backup capacities, and plants with NG had lower direct, onsite life cycle land use than plants with MB or TES. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The institutional arrangement chosen by the leading nations in order to address financial regulatory reform in the wake of the 2007--2009 crisis exhibits two key features of global economic governance innovation. First, it employs a minilateral approach, restricting the participants that negotiate new regulatory standards to a few, highly involved stakeholders. Second, it relies heavily on government networks that operate on the basis of soft law. The arrangement circumvents the traditional intergovernmental model that has proven overly rigid and ineffective in addressing the problems that arise from highly interconnected and fast-changing global markets. Current theories of global economic governance predict that this twofold innovation enhances the effectiveness of financial regulatory reform. Yet a study of the evolution in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives regulation shows that this is not the case. The paper then exposes three obstacles to cross-border regulatory cooperation between the two dominant players, the European Union and the United States. Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned about the distributive consequences of regulation, legislators and legislation hinder cross-border harmonization, and government networks are weak and incomplete. The paper concludes with suggestions of how to overcome coordination failure and theoretical implications for the political economy of networked governance.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity offsets (BO) are increasingly promoted and adopted by governments and companies worldwide as a policy instrument to compensate for biodiversity losses from infrastructure development projects. BO are often classified as `market-based instruments' both by proponents and critics, but this representation fails to capture the varieties of how BO policies actually operate. To provide a framing for understanding the empirical diversity of BO policy designs, we present an ideal-typical typology based on the institutions from which BO is organised: Public Agency, Mandatory Market and Voluntary Offset. With cross-case comparison and stakeholder mapping, we identified the institutional arrangements of six BO policies to analyse how the biodiversity losses and gains are decided. Based on these results, we examined how these six policies relate to the BO ideal types. Our results suggested that the government, contrary to received wisdom, plays a key role not just in enforcing mandatory policies but also in determining the supply and demand of biodiversity units, supervising the transaction or granting legitimacy to the compensation site. Mandatory BO policies can be anything from pure government regulations defining industry liabilities to liability-driven markets where choice sets for trading credits are constrained and biodiversity credit prices are negotiated under state supervision. It is important to distinguish between two processes in BO: the matching of biodiversity losses and gains (commensurability) and the trading of biodiversity credits (commodification). We conclude that the commensurability of natural capital is restricted in BO policies; biodiversity is always exchanged with biodiversity. However, different degrees of commodification are possible, depending on the policy design and role of price signals in trading credits. Like payments for ecosystem services, the price of a biodiversity credit is most commonly based on the cost of management measures rather than the `value' of biodiversity; which corresponds to a low degree of commodification.},

We distinguish three impact mechanisms: shareholder engagement, capital allocation, and indirect impacts, concluding that the impact of shareholder engagement is well supported in the literature, the impact of capital allocation only partially, and indirect impacts lack empirical support. Our results suggest that investors who seek impact should pursue shareholder engagement throughout their portfolio, allocate capital to sustainable companies whose growth is limited by external financing conditions, and screen out companies based on the absence of specific environmental, social, and governance practices that can be adopted at reasonable costs. For rating agencies, we outline steps to develop investor impact metrics. For policy makers, we highlight that sustainable investing helps diffuse good business practices, but is unlikely to drive a deeper transformation without additional policy measures.},

  abstract = {Conservation biologists are devoting an increasing amount of energy to debating whether land sparing (high-yielding agriculture on a small land footprint) or land sharing (low-yielding, wildlife-friendly agriculture on a larger land footprint) will promote better outcomes for local and global biodiversity. In turn, concerns are mounting about how to feed the world, given increasing demands for food. In this review, I evaluate the land-sparing/land-sharing framework---does the framework stimulate research and policy that can reconcile agricultural land use with biodiversity conservation, or is a revised framing needed? I review (1) the ecological evidence in favor of sparing versus sharing; (2) the evidence from land-use change studies that assesses whether a relationship exists between agricultural intensification and land sparing; and (3) how that relationship may be affected by socioeconomic and political factors. To address the trade-off between biodiversity conservation and food production, I then ask which forms of agricultural intensification can best feed the world now and in the future. On the basis of my review, I suggest that the dichotomy of the land-sparing/land-sharing framework limits the realm of future possibilities to two, largely undesirable, options for conservation. Both large, protected regions and favorable surrounding matrices are needed to promote biodiversity conservation; they work synergistically and are not mutually exclusive. A ``both-and'' framing of large protected areas surrounded by a wildlife-friendly matrix suggests different research priorities from the ``either-or'' framing of sparing versus sharing. Furthermore, wildlife-friendly farming methods such as agroecology may be best adapted to provide food for the world's hungry people.},

This paper conducts a comprehensive review of techno-economic assumptions in the electricity sector among fifteen different global and national integrated assessment models. Particular focus is given to six major economies in the world: Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan and the US. The comparison reveals that techno-economic characteristics are quite different across integrated assessment models, both for the base year and future years. It is, however, important to recognize that techno-economic assessments from the literature exhibit an equally large range of parameters as the integrated assessment models reviewed. Beyond numerical differences, the representation of technologies also differs among models, which needs to be taken into account when comparing numerical parameters. While desirable, it seems difficult to fully harmonize techno-economic parameters across a broader range of models due to structural differences in the representation of technology. Therefore, making techno-economic parameters available in the future, together with of the technology representation as well as the exact definitions of the parameters should become the standard approach as it allows an open discussion of appropriate assumptions.},

While numerous researchers have noted the increasing salience of finance, there have been few systematic attempts to consider what this shift means for the nature of the economy, considered broadly. In large part, this omission reflects the considerable methodological difficulties associated with using national economic data to assess the rise of finance as a macro-level phenomenon shaping patterns of accumulation in the US economy. The paper develops two discrete measures of financialization and applies these measures to postwar US economic data in order to determine if, and to what extent, the US economy is becoming financialized. The paper concludes by considering some of the implications of financialization for two areas of ongoing debate in the social sciences: (1) the question of who controls the modern corporation; and (2) the controversy surrounding the extent to which globalization has eroded the autonomy of the state.},

  abstract = {To alleviate many parking-related externalities, several rapidly growing cities globally are optimizing parking through ``smart-parking'' programs, involving measures such as adjusting parking prices based upon demand, making payments easier, and significantly improving parking-related information dissemination. There are few rigorous empirical estimates regarding the efficacy of these policies, particularly for outcomes such as transit ridership or traffic flow, which are of key policy relevance. Exploiting features of the roll out of SFpark, a smart-parking program for the city of San Francisco, we are able to estimate its effect upon public transit usage and traffic flow. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and a rich micro data-set on transit bus ridership along with data from SFpark, we find that SFpark led to a significant increase in bus ridership and a reduction in traffic flow. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the economic benefits resulting from avoided pollution and reduced congestion consequent to SFpark is larger than the approximate nominal costs of the program. Overall, our results suggest that smart-parking programs can help mitigate many traffic-related externalities, yielding significant economic benefits.},

For example, copper ores contain elements, like sulphur, which could be damaging. Recently, global copper-demand increased, mainly due to rising Chinese imports. In the longer-term, the environmental impacts could intensify as an increase in demand for copper products is expected, so enforcing growing mining and processing activities. However, at least two trends can counteract these developments: technical progress and increased use of recycled metal. The objective of this study is to discuss whether the trends will enforce a sustainable development of the copper material flow, focusing on carbon-dioxide emissions and sulphur. The study is made by using a process-based partial equilibrium model, modelling the global copper material flow, considering recycling of copper as well as by-products. The allocation of output and technology to regions is based on economic decisions subject to the constraints set by existing techniques. By discussing the longer-run development of the global copper material flow, one scenario will be computed. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Like the learning abilities of their students, the teaching abilities of college professors seem to develop in stages. In this paper I want to offer an account of how this development sometimes, and perhaps often, proceeds. Typically, when they begin their teaching careers, professors focus their concern primarily on their own role in the classroom (stage 1: self). When they have mastered this role, at least to their own satisfaction, the focus of their concern shifts, first to their understanding of the subject matter they teach (stage 2: subject) and then to their students' ability to absorb what they have been taught (stage 3: student). With this last shift comes a more general shift of focus from teaching to learning, that begins, in stage 3, with a focus on helping their students become more absorbent (stage 3: student as receptive). Concern then typically shifts to helping students learn to use what they have been taught (stage 4: student as active) and then to helping them to learn on their own (stage 5: student as independent). My account of this development is based on the informal observation of a few cases and it suggests a framework for thinking about the development of professors as teachers. With further work, it might lead to theories that will describe what does happen and predict what will happen.},

  abstract = {The combined influences of a change in climate patterns and the increased concentration of property and economic activity in hazard-prone areas has the potential of restricting the availability and affordability of insurance. This paper evaluates the premiums that private insurers are likely to charge and their ability to cover residential losses against hurricane risk in Florida as a function of (a) recent projections on future hurricane activity in 2020 and 2040; (b) insurance market conditions (i.e., soft or hard market); (c) the availability of reinsurance; and (d) the adoption of adaptation measures (i.e., implementation of physical risk reduction measures to reduce wind damage to the structure and buildings). We find that uncertainties in climate projections translate into a divergent picture for insurance in Florida. Under dynamic climate models, the total price of insurance for Florida (assuming constant exposure) could increase significantly by 2040, from \$12.9 billion (in 1990) to \$14.2 billion, under hard market conditions. Under lower bound projections, premiums could decline to \$9.4 billion by 2040. Taking a broader range of climate change scenarios, including several statistical ones, prices could be between \$4.7 and \$32.1 billion by 2040. The upper end of this range suggests that insurance could be unaffordable for many people in Florida. The adoption of most recent building codes for all residences in the state could reduce by nearly half the expected price of insurance so that even under high climate change scenarios, insurance premiums would be lower than under the 1990 baseline climate scenario. Under a full adaptation scenario, if insurers can obtain reinsurance, they will be able to cover 100~\% of the loss if they allocated 10~\% of their surplus to cover a 100-year return hurricane, and 63~\% and 55~\% of losses from a 250-year hurricane in 2020 and 2040. Property-level adaptation and the maintenance of strong and competitive reinsurance markets will thus be essential to maintain the affordability and availability of insurance in the new era of catastrophe risk.},

At the moment when economic experts are forecasting domestic growth in France of only 0.6\% for this year, and less than 2\% for 2011, one of the fundamental aspects to address for the optimisation of the performance of a SME would appear to be its structure. The Supply Chain remains the backbone of Small and Medium Enterprises and its optimisation implies good overall control of the system concerning transport and distribution as well as internal logistics. GRAI Methodology is one of the three main methodologies (with PERA and CIMOSA) used for modelling enterprises. To support this methodology different tools have been developed. A module called GRAIQUAL for implementing, managing and improving quality in SMEs is being developed. It goes without saying that this article will also include the environmental dimension present through the need to reduce the carbon footprint in the Supply Chain. After a short presentation of the concepts of GRAIQUAL and the new performance criterion (the carbon footprint), a detailed case study will be presented to show the concepts of optimisation of Supply Chain performance using GRAI Methodology. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

While this framework has been highly influential, a critical shortcoming for its application in sustainability governance is that it currently fails to represent how impacts related to one of the planetary boundaries affect the status of other planetary boundaries. Here, we surveyed and provisionally quantified interactions between the Earth system processes represented by the planetary boundaries and investigated their consequences for sustainability governance. We identified a dense network of interactions between the planetary boundaries. The resulting cascades and feedbacks predominantly amplify human impacts on the Earth system and thereby shrink the safe operating space for future human impacts on the Earth system. Our results show that an integrated understanding of Earth system dynamics is critical to navigating towards a sustainable future.},

It comprises four sections. I first situate academic finance within the broader spectrum of social sciences and highlight its ontological, epistemological and methodological assumptions. Second, I show that these assumptions, taken for granted within the field of finance, are the object of much debate within other fields -- as is demonstrated by controversy regarding logical positivism, social ontology and performativity -- which brings out the limitations of paradigmatic unity in finance. Third, I characterize diversification in finance with reference to the nested epistemological structure of scientific discourse. I argue that diversification is a process by which (i) finance research is extended to other existing paradigms in social sciences; (ii) new research metaphors are developed within the current paradigm; and (iii) puzzle-solving robustness is achieved. Fourth, I develop a research agenda for the diversification of academic finance. This agenda is broken down into themes, paradigmatic hypotheses, and research questions. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Multifunctionality is a recurring issue in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of primary metals production, as one metal is often co-produced with other metals. In this context, this study aims at i) reviewing the approaches actually implemented in the literature for solving multifunctionality in the context of the LCA of primary metals co-production; ii) comparing the currently existing multifunctionality-solving approaches as defined by the ISO hierarchy, considering the carbon footprint assessment (in a life-cycle perspective) of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb) and silver (Ag) co-production through the implementation of on-site ``mine-to-metal'' technologies at pilot scale in a Spanish mine; iii) discussing the implications associated with the use of these different approaches in the context of primary metals co-production and the extent to which they may affect the assessment of the environmental performances of metals. Overall, the allocation approach stands for the first option for solving multifunctionality in the LCA of metals co-production based on the review of 27 studies; despite the ISO hierarchy recommends the use of allocation as last resort. Based on a representative set of primary data drawn from on-site trials at a pilot scale, the potential climate change impacts induced by the co-production of 1 ton Cu and 6 tons Zn cathodes along with 2.65 tons Pb and 0.045 ton Ag precipitates are calculated to amount to 90,324 kg CO2-eq in a life cycle perspective. Depending on the multifunctionality-solving approach, the apportionment of these impacts to each co-product shows significant discrepancies. The implementation of partial subdivision combined with market prices allocation attributes most (80\%) of the impacts to Zn and Ag. The use of allocation approaches attribute the largest share of impacts to Zn (62\%) and Pb (27\%) when considering a mass criterion; while the impacts are primarily attributed to Ag (respectively 48\% and 45\%) and Zn (respectively 30\% and 33\%) when considering economic criteria (respectively market prices and production costs). In terms of representativeness, the use of partial subdivision shall be considered as a more representative approach for solving multifunctionality than the mere application of allocation. Moreover, the results obtained through the application of economic allocation are considered more consistent than those obtained by mass allocation in this case study; while the use of production costs may be seen as an alternative for overcoming the limits associated with market prices. Finally, the use of system expansion shows that the recovery of Zn, Pb and Ag in addition to Cu potentially avoids 25\% of the total climate change impacts. The approach implemented to solve multifunctionality largely influences the estimated impacts of each co-produced metal, subsequently with potential large implications for the footprints of products and sectors using these metals. The way multifunctionality is solved shall therefore be transparently reported in the scope of LCA studies, with privileging subdivision whenever possible.},

Given the current absence of a common language for what impact is, and the diversity in methodological approaches and methods for how impact may be assessed, a unifying framework would facilitate comparisons of performance of impact investment funds. Philanthropic organisations, foundations, investors and fund managers could benefit from such a unifying framework to assess, compare and aggregate impact across all investee firms, portfolios, and firm types in a spectrum of Social Purpose Organisations (SPOs) and over time. Furthermore, a unifying framework could provide contemporaneous assessment of a SPO's double or multiple bottom lines, as well as evaluate and manage intended and unintended outcomes of an intervention. These are essential for managerial decision making, business model pivoting or impact scaling. We advocate social impact as that which derives from an impact value chain where we distinguish outputs from outcomes and impacts. We further propose that the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN)'s characterisation of impact investing can provide a unifying framework for impact assessment along this impact value chain.},

One key aspect of sustainability science, therefore, is the involvement of actors from outside academia into the research process in order to integrate the best available knowledge, reconcile values and preferences, as well as create ownership for problems and solution options. Transdisciplinary, community-based, interactive, or participatory research approaches are often suggested as appropriate means to meet both the requirements posed by real-world problems as well as the goals of sustainability science as a transformational scientific field. Dispersed literature on these approaches and a variety of empirical projects applying them make it difficult for interested researchers and practitioners to review and become familiar with key components and design principles of how to do transdisciplinary sustainability research. Starting from a conceptual model of an ideal--typical transdisciplinary research process, this article synthesizes and structures such a set of principles from various strands of the literature and empirical experiences. We then elaborate on them, looking at challenges and some coping strategies as experienced in transdisciplinary sustainability projects in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia. The article concludes with future research needed in order to further enhance the practice of transdisciplinary sustainability research.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas accountings, commonly referred to with the popular term carbon footprints (CFP), are a widely used metric of climate change impacts and the main focus of many sustainability policies among companies and authorities. However, environmental sustainability concerns not just climate change but also other environmental problems, like chemical pollution or depletion of natural resources, and the focus on CFP brings the risk of problem shifting when reductions in CFP are obtained at the expense of increase in other environmental impacts. But how real is this risk? Here, we model and analyze the life cycle impacts from about 4000 different products, technologies, and services taken from several sectors, including energy generation, transportation, material production, infrastructure, and waste management. By investigating the correlations between the CFP and 13 other impact scores, we show that some environmental impacts, notably those related to emissions of toxic substances, often do not covary with climate change impacts. In such situations, carbon footprint is a poor representative of the environmental burden of products, and environmental management focused exclusively on CFP runs the risk of inadvertently shifting the problem to other environmental impacts when products are optimized to become more "green". These findings call for the use of more broadly encompassing tools to assess and manage environmental sustainability. {\copyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

While the transport and electricity sectors have been thoroughly analyzed in this regard, that of the hydrocarbon industry has not received the same attention, maybe in part due to the difficulty of access to the necessary data. To fill this gap, we assemble public-domain data from a wide variety of sources to present a stock-flow dynamic model of the fossil fuels supply chain. It is conducted from 1950 to 2050 and along scenarios from the International Energy Agency. We estimate the concrete, steel, aluminum and copper requirements for each segment, as well as the embedded energy and CO2 emissions through a dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) model. We find that (i) the material intensities of oil, gas and coal supply chains have stagnated for more than 30 years; (ii) gas is the main driver of current and future material consumption; and (iii) recycled steel from decommissioned fossil fuels infrastructures could meet the cumulative need of future low-carbon technologies and reduce its energy and environmental toll. Furthermore, we highlight that regional decommissioning strategies significantly affect the potential of material recycling and reuse. In this context, ambitious decommissioning strategies could drive a symbolic move to build future renewable technologies from past fossil fuel structures.},

We furthermore highlight the crucial temporal aspect of policies to successfully implement these solutions, as long lifetimes are observed in the building sector.},

  abstract = {We experimentally study decision-making in a novel dynamic coordination game. The game captures features of a transition between externality networks. Groups consisting of three subjects start in a stable benchmark equilibrium with network externality. Over seven rounds, they can transit to an alternative stable equilibrium based on the other network. The alternative network has higher payoffs, but the transition is slow and costly. Coordination is required to implement the transition while minimizing costs. In the experiment, the game is repeated five times, which enables groups to learn to coordinate over time. We compare a neutral language treatment with a `green framing' treatment, in which meaningful context is added to the instructions. We find the green framing to significantly increase the number of profitable transitions, but also to inhibit the learning from past experiences, and thus it reduces coherence of strategies. Consequently, payoffs in both treatments are similar even though the green framing results in twice as many transitions. In the context of environmental policy, the experiment suggests general support for `going green', but we also find evidence for anchoring of beliefs by green framing; proponents and opponents stick to their initial strategies.},

  abstract = {Increased efforts are required to prevent further losses to terrestrial~biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it~ provides1,2. Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether---and how---humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by~the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042--2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34--50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats---such as climate change---must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

  abstract = {The demand for biobased products, such as food, fuel, and chemicals, has been continuously increasing. Meanwhile, agricultural production, serving as the primary stage of biobased products, is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient releases. Environmental impacts of agricultural production influenced by farming practices, soil properties, and climate conditions, are often site-specific and time dependent. Although assessing spatially and temporally explicit environmental releases and impacts are required to inform a sustainable trajectory for agricultural production, such analyses are largely lacking. This study provides site-specific analysis of on-farm and supply chain emissions from corn production to demonstrate the spatio-temporal variability of environmental impacts in the U.S. Midwest states. Using process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) and the physically-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, we estimated county-level life cycle environmental release inventories from corn production in 12 U.S. Midwest states for the period of 2000--2008. Based on the Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) impact assessment model, we quantified the corresponding life cycle global warming (GW), eutrophication (EU) and acidification (AD) impacts of corn. The results show that life cycle GW, EU and AD of corn production varied by factors of 4.2, 83.7 and 10.6, respectively, across the Midwest counties over the nine-year span (2000--2008). Life cycle GW impacts of producing 1\,kg of corn ranged from~-6.4 in Franklin County, Illinois to 20.2\,kg CO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. The life cycle EU impacts also spanned over a wide range of 0.99\,g in Morton County, Kansas to 82.9\,g N-eq. in Leelanau County, Michigan, whereas life cycle AD impacts ranged from 1.3 in Clermont County, Ohio to 100.7\,g SO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. Moreover, trade-offs existed among life cycle GW, EU and AD impact categories for corn production. The spatial variation analyses showed that key contributors were the different soil types, precipitation, elevation and the amounts of fertilizers applied. These findings provided critical insight into spatio-temporal variations of life cycle environmental impacts of corn production and identified spatial hotspots and top contributors for improving environmental performances of corn production.},

The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability; 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk; 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk; to conduct empirical research to assess future risks; and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk.},

  abstract = {Resources--environment--economy coordinated development (REECD) is important for global sustainable development goals (SDGs). Integrated assessment model (IAM) is widely applied to investigate REECD-related issues and design policy or technology development pathways. Accordingly, this study reviews existing literatures on the REECD related IAMs in terms of nexus mechanism, classification, theoretical basis and applicability, and puts forward possible expansion dimensions for improving the models. IAMs could be categorized into top-down ones mainly based on computable general equilibrium and optimization theories, and bottom-up ones generally based on engineering-technological and ecology-environmental analysis. Top-down and bottom-up combined IAMs are increasingly employed to evaluate the impacts of policy implementation, technological penetration and behavior modification, in order to improve the accuracy for decision-making. Meanwhile, IAMs for REECD are need to be further developed to increase its applicability for analyzing high-resolution and high-frequency inventories of resource development and pollutant emissions. Existing IAMs should also embrace key resources consumption such as heavy and strategic metals. Due to tighter carbon emission space under 1.5-degree and carbon-neutral climate targets, the nexus mechanism of REECD would change significantly in future, which we need to characterize these variations in the models. Furthermore, researchers and developers should pay more attention to model improvement towards the developing and emerging economies.

To illustrate potential insights enabled by our datasets, we performed detailed assessments of the geographical distribution of global mine areas in terms of their spatial density, elevations, and areas relative to rivers basins, climate zones, and human development factors. Our study promotes increasing access to high-quality spatial data to facilitate more systematic global management of mine wastes, pollution and mine land management.},

It also studies if the abnormal returns - found in the literature - for sin stocks persist after controlling for investor sentiment. Furthermore, we utilize a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity-in-mean (GARCH) model to study the relationship between investor sentiment and the sin portfolio's conditional volatility. Our findings show that both individual and institutional investor sentiment are priced factors in sin stock returns. Furthermore, after controlling for the role of investor sentiment, the asset-pricing results suggest that the abnormal returns for sin stocks found in previous studies disappear. The results from the GARCH models indicate that investor sentiment has a significant impact on sin stocks' conditional volatility.},

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has enabled consideration of environmental impacts beyond the narrow boundary of traditional engineering methods. This reduces the chance of shifting impacts outside the system boundary. However, sustainability also requires that supporting ecosystems are not adversely affected and remain capable of providing goods and services for supporting human activities. Conventional LCA does not account for this role of nature, and its metrics are best for comparing alternatives. These relative metrics do not provide information about absolute environmental sustainability, which requires comparison between the demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES). Techno-ecological synergy (TES) is a framework to account for ES, and has been demonstrated by application to systems such as buildings and manufacturing activities that have narrow system boundaries. This article develops an approach for techno-ecological synergy in life cycle assessment (TES-LCA) by expanding the steps in conventional LCA to incorporate the demand and supply of ecosystem goods and services at multiple spatial scales. This enables calculation of absolute environmental sustainability metrics, and helps identify opportunities for improving a life cycle not just by reducing impacts, but also by restoring and protecting ecosystems. TES-LCA of a biofuel life cycle demonstrates this approach by considering the ES of carbon sequestration, air quality regulation, and water provisioning. Results show that for the carbon sequestration ecosystem service, farming can be locally sustainable but unsustainable at the global or serviceshed scale. Air quality regulation is unsustainable at all scales, while water provisioning is sustainable at all scales for this study in the eastern part of the United States.},

  abstract = {A reduction in the overall carbon intensity (CI) of a crop-based biofuel can be achieved by cutting down the CI of the biofuel's feedstock, which in turn correlates significantly to agricultural management practices. Proposals are being made to incentivize low-carbon biofuel feedstocks under U.S. fuel regulatory programs to promote sustainable farming practices by individual farms. For such an incentive scheme to function properly, robust data collection and verification are needed at the farm level. This study presents our collaboration with U.S. private sector companies to collect and verify the corn production data necessary for feedstock-specific CI calculation at the farm level, through a carefully designed questionnaire, to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of data collection at scale. We surveyed 71 farms that produced 0.2 million metric tons of corn grain in 2018 in a Midwestern U.S. state to obtain information on key parameters affecting corn ethanol feedstock CI, such as grain yields, fertilizer/chemical application rates, and agronomic practices. Feedstock-specific CI was calculated in the unit of grams (g) CO2 equivalent (CO2e) of greenhouse gases per kilogram (kg) of corn produced. Results showed large CI variations---from 119 to 407 g CO2e kg-1 of corn---due to the farm-level inventory, while the production-weighted average CI for all surveyed farms was 210 g CO2e kg-1, comparable to the national average CI of 204 g CO2e kg-1. The nitrogen fertilizer type applied and rate were identified as key factors contributing most to CI variations at the farm level. The estimated N2O emissions from fertilizer and biomass nitrogen inputs to soil accounted for 51\% of the overall farm-level CI and therefore need to be better monitored at farm level with high resolution. We concluded that this feedstock-specific, farm-level CI evaluation has the potential to be used to incentivize low-carbon feedstock for biofuel production.},

The emerging discipline of behavioral economics and finance has challenged the EMH, arguing that markets are not rational, but rather driven by fear and greed. Research in the cognitive neurosciences suggests these two perspectives are opposite sides of the same coin. An adaptive markets hypothesis that reconciles market efficiency with behavioral alternatives applies the principles of evolution-competition, adaptation, and natural selection-to financial interactions. Extending Simon's notion of "satisficing" with evolutionary dynamics, the author argues that much of what behaviorists cite as counter-examples to economic rationality-loss aversion, overconfidence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases-is in fact consistent with an evolutionary model of individual adaptation to a changing environment via simple heuristics. The adaptive markets hypothesis offers a number of surprisingly concrete implications for portfolio management.},

  abstract = {Biological insurance theory predicts that, in a variable environment, aggregate ecosystem properties will vary less in more diverse communities because declines in the performance or abundance of some species or phenotypes will be offset, at least partly, by smoother declines or increases in others. During the past two decades, ecology has accumulated strong evidence for the stabilising effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. As biological insurance is reaching the stage of a mature theory, it is critical to revisit and clarify its conceptual foundations to guide future developments, applications and measurements. In this review, we first clarify the connections between the insurance and portfolio concepts that have been used in ecology and the economic concepts that inspired them. Doing so points to gaps and mismatches between ecology and economics that could be filled profitably by new theoretical developments and new management applications. Second, we discuss some fundamental issues in biological insurance theory that have remained unnoticed so far and that emerge from some of its recent applications. In particular, we draw a clear distinction between the two effects embedded in biological insurance theory, i.e. the effects of biodiversity on the mean and variability of ecosystem properties. This distinction allows explicit consideration of trade-offs between the mean and stability of ecosystem processes and services. We also review applications of biological insurance theory in ecosystem management. Finally, we provide a synthetic conceptual framework that unifies the various approaches across disciplines, and we suggest new ways in which biological insurance theory could be extended to address new issues in ecology and ecosystem management. Exciting future challenges include linking the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and stability, incorporating multiple functions and feedbacks, developing new approaches to partition biodiversity effects across scales, extending biological insurance theory to complex interaction networks, and developing new applications to biodiversity and ecosystem management.},

This ``weak sustainable consumption'' governance, however, is not able to address the challenges to sustainable development arising from overconsumption in general or the rebound effect and distributive issues in particular. In contrast, a ``strong sustainable consumption'' perspective provides a basis for a promising inquiry into the linkages between consumption and sustainable development as well as a fruitful exchange with degrowth. Specifically, it allows the delineation of relevant insights on the role of values in governance, obstacles to political reform, and promising political strategies for the degrowth debate and literature.},

With global extraction of metal ores doubling over the past two decades, pressures related to mining have dramatically increased. In this paper, we explore where growing global metal extraction has particularly taken effect. Using fine-grain data, we investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of mining of nine metal ores (bauxite, copper, gold, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, silver and zinc) across approximately 3,000 sites of extraction worldwide between 2000 and 2019. To approach the related environmental implications, we intersect mining sites with terrestrial biomes, protected areas, and watersheds categorised by water availability. We find that 79\% of global metal ore extraction in 2019 originated from five of the six most species-rich biomes, with mining volumes doubling since 2000 in tropical moist forest ecosystems. We also find that half of global metal ore extraction took place at 20 km or less from protected territories. Further, 90\% of all considered extraction sites correspond to below-average relative water availability, with particularly copper and gold mining occurring in areas with significant water scarcity. Our study has far-reaching implications for future global and local policy and resource management responses to mitigate the negative effects of the expected expansion of metal mining.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we critically analyze how sustainability is considered in aquaculture policies and strategies using the Nordic countries as a case. The strong versus weak sustainability concepts are used to define and clarify what sustainability aspects are central to each state. To illustrate these concepts further, we draw on and modify four mainstream environmental discourses defined by John Dryzek and apply them to the strong and weak sus\- tainability dichotomy to help categorize how environmental sustainability is portrayed in Nordic aquaculture policies and strategies. Subsequently we apply the characteristics of the concepts to aquaculture and sustain\- ability in the Nordic countries. This allows us to identify each state's depiction of sustainable aquaculture, compare these to one another and assess where the Nordic states position themselves regarding sustainability and aquaculture. Our findings show that the policies emphasize technological advancements, intensification, and economic growth, which correlates with weak sustainability. Environmental sustainability receives a significant role in the documents too but does not seem to trump increased intensification or profitability. All policies are heavily focused on fed aquaculture and in order to reduce negative impacts from aquaculture there is a need to incorporate key elements of strong sustainability in policies, including measures to reduce impacts from pollution and the spread of pathogens, use of high-grade food resources and energy consumption. This to transform the industry to sustainability rather than just making it less unsustainable.},

  abstract = {The iron and steel industry in China is suffering from the burden of overcapacity, structural adjustment and upgrading. In order to analyse and improve the energy efficiency, the life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of iron pelletizing are estimated in this work. The direct energy consumption is 793.4 MJ/t, with the largest energy demand being caused by pellets induration process. The equivalent carbon footprint for producing one ton iron pellet is 58.5 kg CO2, and 51.4\% of which comes from the extraction, processing and transportation of raw materials, fuel and electricity. Compared with iron sintering, pelletizing process is more environmentally friendly with lower energy consumption and less GHG emissions. In addition, the SO2, NOx and dust emissions of pelletizing are {$\leq$}5\% of sintering process. Efforts to further improve the pelletizing technologies are addressed to catch up the global technological frontier and to improve its competitiveness. This study not only provides solutions to China's iron and steel industry for energy saving and emission reduction, but also offers ways for self-innovation.},

  abstract = {This paper posits three types of investors in today's financial markets: Universal Investors, Social Investors and Rational Investors. It argues that the Universal and Social Investor are theoretically inclined to seek returns that benefit society and the environment as a whole, while the tenets of modern portfolio theory lead the Rational Investor to seek returns based primarily on market price. Because of the dominance of modern portfolio theory, the actual practices of the Universal and Social Investor reproduce those of the Rational Investor in most regards today. However, Universal and Social Investors are now pioneering at least three investment practices that promote returns to the economy and society. These are engagement with corporate management, investments that benefit underserved communities, and the setting of social and environmental standards in selecting investments. These practices differ from those of the mainstream in that they deliberately take into account more than market price in seeking returns on investments. This paper argues that measuring the value of corporations to society solely on their stock price and their ability to raise that price is not only a narrow expression of the value of corporations to society, but a potentially dangerous one. It views Universal and Social Investors as having the potential to build on and improve upon the practices of Rational Investors by developing an expanded and more complete conception of investment returns and of corporations' role in providing those returns. This paper hypothesises that universal investors and socially responsible investors -- two classes of investors whose investment practices are increasingly gaining recognition around the world -- share a basic affinity for the promotion of a just and sustainable society. Although the two currently differ in certain regards, together they constitute a theoretically coherent model of investment that builds and improves upon the dominant investment theory and practice of rational investors, which focus primarily on market-based returns. Part One of this paper explores the theoretical affinities between universal and socially responsible investors and highlights their points of departure from certain aspects of modern portfolio theory. Part Two examines the emerging investment practices that characterise these investors and that distinguish them from their mainstream colleagues.},

  abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that the performance of investment managers should be measured against some broad market index such as the S\&P 500. The broad market averages provide a useful benchmark because they are assumed to be beyond the influence of investment managers and provide a way of capturing what financial economists call ``systematic risk,'' which is the part of total risk that cannot be avoided through portfolio diversification. But one clear limitation of such an approach to performance evaluation is that by focusing on risks and rewards at the portfolio level only, it fails to consider risks and rewards at a systemic level, where the performance of all portfolios is increasingly likely to be affected. The author begins by making the case that the performance evaluation and collective decision-making of investment managers could have the effect of increasing the level of systematic risk in both the markets and the real economy. Then, after suggesting that the strength or weakness of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks can have substantial effects on overall market returns, he discusses a number of efforts currently underway to integrate ESG factors into portfolio-level decision-making. The author closes by urging asset owners to take the following three steps to help bridge the gap between investment decision-making and ESG consequences: (1) acknowledge the connection between investment decision-making and systems-level risks and rewards; (2) determine which systemic frameworks are most appropriate and useful for their purposes; and (3) implement investment practices that allow them to manage systemic-level risks and rewards while simultaneously achieving competitive financial returns in their portfolios. With the help of new measurement and management tools, asset owners can strengthen systemic frameworks, communicate the importance of ESG performance to their investees and investors, and align their efforts with those of governmental and non-governmental organizations to limit systemic risk.},

Only a small number have been well characterized for potential toxicity, though many are thought to pose health risks. Secrecy is pervasive in chemicals regulation, in part because agencies have deferred to claims that chemical ingredients are covered by the law of trade secrecy. The resulting deficit of data impedes health and ecological research, distorts market responses and suppresses innovation incentives.  This chapter argues that secrecy is out of place in environmental regulation: information that describes environmental externalities is not ``trade'' or ``commercial or financial'' information within the meaning of trade secret law and discharging pollutants without sufficient research abandons secrecy entitlements that might otherwise attach.  Property law does not legitimate harming third parties or avoiding duties to them; also, secrecy reverses the appropriate relationship between property and resources by hiding social costs and blocking efficient allocation.  The better rule would be ``no secret exposures,'' giving firms the choice to avoid exposures, invest in research to prove that their products are reasonably safe, or resort to the patent system or other legitimate strategies.},

However, only a few systematic analyses on the environmental burdens and improvements of China's crude steel production have been conducted. Therefore, it is important for research to be done how China's steel industry can be improved in environment management. To help decision-makers understand this, a life cycle water footprint analysis including gray and blue water was performed based on the methodology prescribed in the ISO 14046 standard. A life cycle assessment was also conducted to improve the environmental performance of the steel industry. Results of these assessments revealed that gray water footprint, which is mainly derived from aquatic eutrophication, carcinogens, and non-carcinogens, is higher than blue water footprint. Optimizing indirect processes, including iron ore mining, magnesium oxide production, transportation, and electricity generation, played dominant roles in the reduction of gray water footprint. Furthermore, COD, Cr (VI), phosphate, BOD5, Hg, As, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and sulfur dioxide were the key substances for environmental improvements. The underestimation of direct water footprint showed the importance and urgency of implementing scientific and adequate monitoring indicators. Meanwhile, the environmental burden can be reduced by adopting a reasonable location of the steel industry on the basis of regional water resources and actual transportation status, improving the efficiency of raw material consumption, and optimizing the power structure.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Ferronickel is irreplaceable in modern infrastructure construction because of its use in stainless steel production. This study explored the cost-combined environmental impacts of ferronickel production in China which is the largest producer and consumer of ferronickel in the world. Methods: Life cycle impact assessment was combined with life cycle costing analysis to assess the environmental and economic performance of ferronickel production in China. Both internal cost (e.g., raw materials, energy, transport, infrastructure, tax, and labor) and external cost (i.e., human health, ecosystem quality, and environmental emission) were considered. Results and discussion: The environmental burden of ferronickel production in this study was mainly attributed to the damage on resources and human health as endpoints caused by indirect processes, such as electricity supply, transportation, coke production, lateritic nickel ore acquisition, and coal mining. Carbon dioxide, mercury, particulates, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, coal, and nickel ores were the substances pivotal for optimizing environmental performance. The total economic cost was 2734.8 \$/t, of which 2333.3 \$/t was internal cost and 401.5 \$/t was external cost. Lateritic nickel ore, electricity, human health cost, and transport contributed 44.9\%, 20.6\%, 14.2\%, and 4.8\% to the total economic cost, respectively. The remaining economic burden was mainly divided to coke, coal, argon, labor, equipment, and tax. Conclusions: A win-win case for the environment and economy can be achieved by optimizing electricity and lateritic nickel ore quality, including its transport. Application of other power types (e.g., hydro, wind, and solar electricity) as a substitute for thermal power can also reduce environmental impacts considerably. Sites with high steel yield, low thermal power ratio, and high port proximity, such as Fujian Province, are the primary choices for ferronickel production. Finally, although the economic benefits of coke and coal are minimal, their efficiency in environmental improvement is crucial.},

Estimates of water factors were collected from published primary literature and were not modified except for unit conversions. The water factors presented may be useful in modeling and policy analyses where reliable power plant level data are not available. Major findings of the report include: water withdrawal and consumption factors vary greatly across and within fuel technologies, and water factors show greater agreement when organized according to cooling technologies as opposed to fuel technologies; a transition to a less carbon-intensive electricity sector could result in either an increase or a decrease in water use, depending on the choice of technologies and cooling systems employed; concentrating solar power technologies and coal facilities with carbon capture and sequestration capabilities have the highest water consumption values when using a recirculating cooling system; and non-thermal renewables, such as photovoltaics and wind, have the lowest water consumption factors. Improved power plant data and further studies into the water requirements of energy technologies in different climatic regions would facilitate greater resolution in analyses of water impacts of future energy and economic scenarios. This report provides the foundation for conducting water use impact assessments of the power sector while also identifying gaps in data that could guide future research. {\copyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {The low-carbon transition is a specific type of rapid structural change where low-emission industries grow and high-emission industries decline due to deliberate policies, changing preferences and technological change. Developing countries' macroeconomic exposure to this transition depends upon their reliance on carbon-intensive industries as a source of foreign currency, fiscal revenue, employment and wage income. Identifying these different dimensions of countries' exposure is important because different green policies need to be applied in different contexts, and the results of these policies will be more or less effective according to countries' idiosyncrasies. This paper aims at providing estimates of countries' macroeconomic current exposures to the low-carbon transition. We develop a method to evaluate countries' external, fiscal and socioeconomic exposure, and, considering their capacity to adapt their productive structure, we analyse countries' vulnerabilities and risks in these different dimensions. Using a Hybrid World Input-output table for 189 countries, we identify the carbon-intensive industries, and then we estimate each country's direct and indirect dependence on these industries, considering countries' dependence for raising of foreign currency to analyse the external exposure, government revenue to evaluate the fiscal exposure, and the share of wages and employment to analyse the socioeconomic exposure. Results show that countries present different degrees of exposure in different dimensions, and the degree of exposure varies significantly when indirect impacts are considered. Moreover, by analysing countries' capacity to adapt their production structure and resilience factors, we evaluate to what extent countries' macroeconomic exposure imply a higher vulnerability to the green transition process.},

Annual and cumulative demands were compared with reserves and current mining rates. The study results showed that reserves are sufficient to support the total level of solar power, wind power and electric motors. Insufficient reserves may very well constrain certain sub-technologies, but substitutes that take the role of `back-stop' technologies can be used instead. The exception is batteries, since lithium battery chemistries and reserves were incompatible with the scenarios analysed. Batteries of moderate size, lithium-free chemistry or reserve expansion would make the transition feasible. Choice of sub-technology (e.g. type of solar PV) had a decisive impact on demand for certain metals. Perceptions that many metals are critical and scarce for renewable energy transitions appear exaggerated if a dynamic view on technological development is adopted. Policy-relevant conclusions can be drawn from this, regarding e.g. the benefits of technological diversity, increasing metal intensity, recycling and integrating infrastructure and energy policies (e.g. fast chargers).},

Here, we present a new approach for quantifying the direct impacts of companies' physical assets on nature based on global maps for eight ecosystem services and biodiversity metrics. We apply this approach to a set of over 2,000 global, publicly traded companies with 580,000 mapped physical assets. We find that companies in utility, real estate, materials, and financial sectors have the largest impacts on average, but there is substantial variation among companies within all sectors. In addition, we use high-resolution satellite imagery to assess the impact of active lithium mines based on their footprints. We show that the impact varies substantially among mines and can also be tracked across time for a mine. This approach enables differentiation among companies and assets based on their impacts to nature relative to their revenue or production.},

To investigate these internal and external transformational effects of IR, important differences between IR and alternative ESG reporting strategies are worked out. Using three matched samples of companies from around the world for the sample period 2002--2011, IR companies are matched with companies applying (a) no ESG reporting, (b) stand-alone ESG reporting, or (c) ESG reporting in the annual report. The results suggest that IR is a superior mechanism only for the integration of ESG issues into the core business model when comparing IR with the ESG reporting strategies of (a) no ESG reporting and (c) ESG reporting in annual reports. In comparison with (b), stand-alone ESG reporting, the results indicate that IR is negatively associated with the ESG integration level and with the economic and ESG performance. Moreover, this negative impact is lower for companies that have already implemented ESG management tools prior to the initiation of IR and is stronger for companies residing in countries with legal requirements for the disclosure of ESG information. A separate change analysis reveals that companies do not benefit from a switch from stand-alone ESG reporting to IR. Thus, this paper provides empirical evidence that contradicts the general notion of IR as a superior reporting mechanism, as the benefits of IR are driven by several factors.},

The sample of the qualitative study consisted of interviews of representatives from six Finnish pension funds. The findings suggested that responsible investment is partly confused concept. General approach is responsibility being part of investment decision-making and that portfolio managers have important role. Some have responsible investment specialist or steering group. It depends of the asset class how challenging the responsible investment implementation is and different asset classes have considerably unequal approaches. Derivatives are rarely considered in responsible investment strategies. Some institutions have more developed methods for estimating RI performance, while others trust more on their intuition. Pension funds are not actively cooperating with each other. Competition between pension funds appeared as significant factor amongst private pension funds, whereas requirements from owners or highest management in context of public pension funds. For public pension funds RI is tightly connected to risk management, while private pension funds rarely consider it as part of risk management. Extra-financial returns or impact investing are sometimes regarded as charity, which could suggest that pension funds still focus on financial returns above all. Things seen as RI's possibilities among pension funds are rather different than things driving RI's mainstreaming.},

  abstract = {Social-ecological systems (SES) research has gained substantial momentum, as witnessed by the growth in SES publications, theories, and frameworks, and the traction these concepts have gained in development and policy arenas. However, the growth and development of the SES field has only been partially examined, which limits our ability to make sense of and support the future development of the field and its ability to inform pressing sustainability challenges. The aim of this study is to understand how SES research has grown and changed over time as a field of study using bibliometric methods, co-authorship and co-citation network analysis. Our study is informed by broader bodies of work that have sought to understand the development of scientific fields, concepts, and research agendas. We highlight key trends that have influenced the organization of the field as well as how key thematic areas of SES research have evolved over time. Our results indicate that the research on SES is (i) mainly carried out by authors located in North America and Europe, (ii) characterized by changes in the terminology employed, as identified through our search terms, (iii) linked to the emergence of major conferences and centers dedicated to SES research, as well as its growth over time, (iv) characterized by a highly interconnected structure, with almost 80\% of scholars being connected to each other, and (v) characterized by a shift in citation patterns, with newcomers in the network carving out their niche and replacing the founding figures as the central focus. We discuss the implications of these findings, including the nature of SES research as an ``epistemic network,'' the highly collaborative nature of SES research, and the role played by open-access journals in the growth of SES research in the digital era. We further suggest that the SES research field is at a critical transition point, with contending visions of its future following a more disciplinary path or remaining as a more open interdisciplinary space. We conclude with the questions this raises for future SES research regarding the implications of this duality on the nature, production, and validation of knowledge and its evolution.},

  abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly being considered as an option to reduce societies' vulnerability to natural hazards, creating co-benefits while protecting ecosystem services in a context of changing climate patterns with more frequent and extreme weather events. The reinsurance and insurance industries are increasingly cited as sectors that can play a role to help manage risks, by improving disaster risk reduction (DRR) and loss prevention. This paper investigates how the (re)insurance industry could support the transition from a paradigm focused on ex-post responses to ex-ante risk reduction measures including NBS, in line with the Sendai Framework. This paper presents the results of a series of 61 interviews undertaken with the (re)insurance sector and related actors under the EU H2020 Nature Insurance Value Assessment and Demonstration (NAIAD) project. Methods based on a Grounded Theory approach indicate how this sector can play different roles in loss prevention, including ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (eco-DRR). Results illustrate how the (re)insurance industry, under these roles, is gradually innovating by having a better understanding of hazards and mitigation. The findings of the study contribute to wider discussions such as the possibility of new arrangements like natural insurance schemes and evidence-based assessment of avoided damage costs from green protective measures, in Europe and beyond.},

Environmental policy, in the form of a subsidy aiming to incentivize the adoption of a green technology, on the one hand, directly increases households' extrinsic motivation, while, on the other hand, indirectly decreases their intrinsic motivation. We show that, provided that the indirect effect dominates, the policy leads to crowding-out of intrinsic motivation which ultimately undermines the effectiveness of the policy itself. Specifically, despite its positive effect on environmental outcomes in the short run, the policy will lead to a deterioration in long-run environmental outcomes, giving rise to a reverse green-paradox-like outcome. Moreover, even in the case in which the direct effect dominates, provided that the indirect effect is large enough, the policy will generate a deterioration in short-run environmental outcomes. These results clearly suggest that the optimal design of environmental policy is particularly complicated since it requires to take into account also its effects on intrinsic motivation.},

Our review starts from the insight that shareholders can create impact not only through (1) portfolio screening and (2) shareholder engagement (two impact strategies most used by mainstream shareholders) but also through (3) field building (an impact strategy most used by shareholders at the periphery of the financial sector). Based on this framework of three impact strategies, we integrate insights from four disciplines (management, finance, sociology, and ethics/sustainability) to reconstruct how each impact strategy influences corporate sustainability. We identify 15 impact mechanisms through which the impact strategies produce three types of impact: portfolio screening and shareholder engagement mostly create direct impact on companies, while field building creates indirect impact via other shareholders and indirect impact via the institutional context. Our review suggests that shareholder impact emerges gradually as different types of shareholders build on each other's efforts, which we use to outline a research agenda on shareholder impact as a distributed process.},

  abstract = {Addressing climate mitigation while meeting global electrification goals will require major transitions from fossil-fuel dependence to large-scale renewable energy deployment. However, renewables require significant land assets per unit energy and could come at high cost to ecosystems, creating potential conflicts between global climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Here, we explore the potential biodiversity implications of alternative future global electrification pathways as depicted under the Shared Socioeconomic Scenarios (SSPs), i.e., alternative trends in societal development. We examined the intersection of high-resolution estimates of global energy densities for ten renewable and conventional technologies with global richness data to estimate technology-specific biodiversity footprints (species per GWh), whereas a Cumulative Biodiversity Impact (CBI) score was used to assess land and biodiversity outcomes of alternative scenarios. Downscaled electricity generation scenarios (2020-2100) were also constrained by alternative land conservation and energy development policies. Unexpectedly, variation among SSPs did not exhibit a clear tradeoff between global climate mitigation and CBI. Rather, CBIs were an outcome of total infrastructure development to meet electricity demand (from population growth and GDP) and the total magnitude of renewable energy development and storage technologies. Renewables assembled along a spectrum from land sharing to sparing. At the land sharing end, biomass-powered electricity from dedicated crops contributed the most to biodiversity impacts due to low energy density, whereas land-sparing technologies (solar) caused more-intense land degradation, but in smaller areas. Our results suggest that local land conservation practices and strategies promoting energy diversification could have greater implications for future biodiversity conflicts than global socioeconomic drivers.},

We suggest that both decentralized institutions that are socially determined as well as centralized institutions that are designed by governmental authorities are important in promoting firm foundings in the environmental context. In a sample of the U.S. solar energy sector we find that state-sponsored incentives, environmental consumption norms, and norms of family interdependence are related to new firm entry in this sector. Our findings also suggest that the efficacy of state-level policies in the sponsoring of entrepreneurial growth is dependent upon the social norms that prevail in the entrepreneur's environment. We expand entrepreneurship theory and the study of institutions and the natural environment by demonstrating the integral role that social norms play in influencing the creation of new firms and by illustrating the potential effect social norms have on the effect of policy that seeks to encourage environmentally responsible economic activity. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

In terms of environmental and climate change effects, organic farming is less polluting than conventional farming when measured per unit of land but not when measured per unit of output. Organic farming, which currently accounts for only 1\% of global agricultural land, is lower yielding on average. Due to higher knowledge requirements, observed yield gaps might further increase if a larger number of farmers would switch to organic practices. Widespread upscaling of organic agriculture would cause additional loss of natural habitats and also entail output price increases, making food less affordable for poor consumers in developing countries. Organic farming is not the paradigm for sustainable agriculture and food security, but smart combinations of organic and conventional methods could contribute toward sustainable productivity increases in global agriculture.},

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the theory of planned behaviour, the study discusses an integrated conceptual framework by thoroughly analysing the empirical studies of last 18 years, from 2001 to 2018. Some of the important measures of these studies have been reviewed, such as country of study, research methodology applied, sample size and respondents selected, model/theory applied, variables selected and significant findings of the study. Findings: The study posits that collectivism, knowledge about sustainable investment, pro-environmental attitude and perceived risk will have a positive impact on attitude (ATT) towards SRI. Moreover, attitude (ATT) and subjective norms (SN) will be positively related to intention (INT) along with the mediating effect of social investing efficacy (SIE) and moderating effects of religiosity beliefs. Practical implications: Besides implications for financial managers, various government bodies, prospective investors and other stakeholders, the study will provide impetus to companies for designing more sustainable funds that can promulgate the values and beliefs of investors. Originality/value: The study incrementally contributes to the literature by way of suggesting a conceptual framework that can be empirically tested by future researchers.},

  abstract = {In every Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment cycle, a multitude of scenarios are assessed, with different scope and emphasis throughout the various Working Group reports and special reports, as well as their respective chapters. Within the reports, the ambition is to integrate knowledge on possible climate futures across the Working Groups and scientific research domains based on a small set of ``framing pathways'' such as the so-called representative concentration pathways (RCPs) in the Fifth IPCC Assessment Report (AR5) and the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). This perspective, initiated by discussions at the IPCC Bangkok workshop in April 2023 on the ``Use of Scenarios in AR6 and Subsequent Assessments'', is intended to serve as one of the community contributions to highlight the needs for the next generation of framing pathways that is being advanced under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) umbrella, which will influence or even predicate the IPCC AR7 consideration of framing pathways. Here we suggest several policy research objectives that such a set of framing pathways should ideally fulfil, including mitigation needs for meeting the Paris Agreement objectives, the risks associated with carbon removal strategies, the consequences of delay in enacting that mitigation, guidance for adaptation needs, loss and damage, and for achieving mitigation in the wider context of societal development goals. Based on this context, we suggest that the next generation of climate scenarios for Earth system models should evolve towards representative emission pathways (REPs) and suggest key categories for such pathways. These framing pathways should address the most critical mitigation policy and adaptation plans that need to be implemented over the next 10 years. In our view, the most important categories are those relevant in the context of the Paris Agreement long-term goal, specifically an immediate action (low overshoot) 1.5 {$^\circ$}C pathway and a delayed action (high overshoot) 1.5 {$^\circ$}C pathway. Two other key categories are a pathway category approximately in line with current (as expressed by 2023) near- and long-term policy objectives, as well as a higher-emission category that is approximately in line with ``current policies'' (as expressed by 2023). We also argue for the scientific and policy relevance in exploring two ``worlds that could have been''. One of these categories has high-emission trajectories well above what is implied by current policies and the other has very-low-emission trajectories which assume that global mitigation action in line with limiting warming to 1.5 {$^\circ$}C without overshoot had begun in 2015. Finally, we note that the timely provision of new scientific information on pathways is critical to inform the development and implementation of climate policy. Under the Paris Agreement, for the second global stocktake, which will occur in 2028, and to inform subsequent development of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) up to 2040, scientific inputs are required by 2027. These needs should be carefully considered in the development timeline of community modelling activities, including those under CMIP7.},

  abstract = {The consumption of freshwater in mining accounts for only a small proportion of the total water use at global and even national scales. However, at regional and local scales, mining may result in significant impacts on freshwater resources, particularly when water consumption surpasses the carrying capacities defined by the amount of available water and also considering environmental water requirements. By applying a geographic information system (GIS), a comprehensive water footprint accounting and water scarcity assessment of bauxite, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, uranium and zinc as well as gold, palladium, platinum and silver was conducted to quantify the influence of mining and refining of metal production on regional water availability and water stress. The observation includes the water consumption and impacts on water stress of almost 2800 mining operations at different production stages, e.g., preprocessed ore, concentrate and refined metal. Based on a brief study of mining activities in 147 major river basins, it can be indicated that mining's contribution to regional water stress varies significantly in each basin. While in most regions mining predominantly results in very low water stress, not surpassing 0.1\% of the basins' available water, there are also exceptional cases where the natural water availability is completely exceeded by the freshwater consumption of the mining sector during the entire year. Thus, this GIS-based approach provides precise information to deepen the understanding of the global mining industry's influence on regional carrying capacities and water stress.},

First, we found that adoption of environmental ERP supported implementation of the corporate environmental sustainability strategy, and at the same time, may transform that very strategy. Second, we uncovered unique data sharing hurdles originating in the upstream energy information value chain. Finally, we identified the role of private equity as one important stakeholder that influences environmental ERP adoption.

They can do so in two ways: by influencing firms' cost of capital; and by voting and engaging management. Both work empirically. Moreover, promoting ESG creates financial value for shareholders. How well sustainable index funds use these two promotion levers varies a lot, though. For example, 37\% of sustainable index funds have a lower ESG score than their non-ESG benchmark. Only 16\% perform more than a simple negative screening and go beyond specific themes while improving ESG scores by at least 5\% and avoiding derivatives. The number and sophistication of sustainable index funds should continue to grow. Frameworks for analyzing them are therefore timely.},

  abstract = {Energy and climate policies may have significant economy-wide impacts, which are regularly assessed based on quantitative energy-environment-economy models. These tend to vary in their conclusions on the scale and direction of the likely macroeconomic impacts of a low-carbon transition. This paper traces the characteristic discrepancies in models' outcomes to their origins in different macro-economic theories, most importantly their treatment of technological innovation and finance. We comprehensively analyse the relevant branches of macro-innovation theory and group them into two classes: `Equilibrium' and `Non-equilibrium'. While both approaches are rigorous and self-consistent, they frequently yield opposite conclusions for the economic impacts of low-carbon policies. We show that model outcomes are mainly determined by their representations of monetary and finance dimensions, and their interactions with investment, innovation and technological change. Improving these in all modelling approaches is crucial for strengthening the evidence base for policy making and gaining a more consistent picture of the macroeconomic impacts of achieving emissions reductions objectives. The paper contributes towards the ongoing effort of enhancing the transparency and understanding of sophisticated model mechanisms applied to energy and climate policy analysis. It helps tackle the overall `black box' critique, much-cited in policy circles and elsewhere. Key policy insights Quantitative models commissioned by policy-makers to assess the macroeconomic impacts of climate policy generate contradictory outcomes and interpretations.The source of the differences in model outcomes originates primarily from assumptions on the workings of the financial sector and the nature of money, and of how these interact with processes of low-carbon energy innovation and technological change.Representations of innovation and technological change are incomplete in energy-economy-environment models, leading to limitations in the assessment of the impacts of climate-related policies.All modelling studies should state clearly their underpinning theoretical school and their treatment of finance and innovation.A strong recommendation is given for modellers of energy-economy systems to improve their representations of money and finance.

The Green Economy (GE) concept is described by various institutions as a vehicle to move towards sustainable resource management. This paper demonstrates the linkages between SDGs and Natural Resources though the systematic analysis of 494 GE indicators, derived from 12 distinct frameworks focusing on GE or on Green Growth. This articulation provides insights to gain an improved understanding of the links between SDGs and Natural Resources and interpret their inherent complexity. GE indicators focus unevenly on SDG, although each SDG is related to at least one resource category. Two complementary typologies were applied to the Materials subcategory to highlight additional characteristics, leading to the proposal of an adaptable analytical framework for the assessment of sustainability issues and GE transitions.},

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement requires mitigation contributions from all Parties. Therefore, the determination of additionality of activities under the market mechanisms of its Article 6 will need to be revisited. This paper provides recommendations on how to operationalize additionality under Article 6.~We first review generic definitions of additionality and current approaches for testing of additionality before discussing under which conditions additionality testing of specific activities or policies is still necessary under the new context of the Paris Agreement, that is, in order to prevent increases of global emissions. We argue that the possibility of `hot air' generation under nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) requires an independent check of the NDC's ambition. If the NDC of the transferring country does contain `hot air', or if the transferred emission reductions are not covered by the NDC, a dedicated additionality test should be required. While additionality tests of projects and programmes could continue to be done through investment analysis, for policy instruments new approaches are required. They should be differentiated according to type of policy instrument. For regulation, we suggest calculating the resulting pay-back period for technology users. If the regulation generates investments exceeding a payback period threshold, it could be deemed additional. Similarly, carbon pricing policies that generate a carbon price exceeding a threshold could qualify; for trading schemes an absence of over-allocation needs to be shown. The threshold should be differentiated according to country categories and rise over time. Key policy insights Without additionality testing, market mechanisms under the Paris Agreements might lead to an international diffusion of `hot air'. To avoid this, an independent assessment of NDC ambition is in order. Otherwise, activities under the mechanisms need to undergo specific additionality tests.Additionality testing of projects and programmes should build on the experience developed under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.Bold approaches are needed for assessing additionality of policies. To avoid cumbersome assessment of all activities triggered by such policies, highly aggregated approaches are suggested, ranging from payback period thresholds for technologies mandated by regulation to minimum price levels triggered by carbon pricing policies. Over time, the stringency of threshold values should increase. Without additionality testing, market mechanisms under the Paris Agreements might lead to an international diffusion of `hot air'.

A new process is reported that features alkaline roasting of titania slag (ARTS), with subsequent washing, leaching, solvent extraction, hydrolysis, and calcination stages, and implements the recycling and regeneration of alkaline and acid process streams to minimize waste generation. A virtual ARTS processing plant is described in detail and is used to conduct an LCA comparison with the sulfate, chloride, and Altairnano processes. The cumulative energy demand (CED) and total CO2 emissions for the ARTS process are 92.6 MJ/kg TiO2 and 7.47 kg CO2/kg TiO2, respectively, which compares favorably with the traditional and Altairnano processes.},

  abstract = {To achieve the goal of keeping global warming well below 2 {$^\circ$}C, private investors have to shift capital from brown to green infrastructures and technologies and provide additional green investment. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic perspective on the challenge of triggering such investments. The question of climate change mitigation is often related to the prisoner's dilemma, a game with one Nash equilibrium. However, the authors perceive investment for mitigation and adaptation as a coordination problem of selecting among multiple equilibria. To illustrate this, we model a non-cooperative coordination game, related to the stag hunt, with a brown equilibrium with lower payoffs that can be achieved single-handedly and a green equilibrium with higher payoffs that requires coordination. As multiple experiments show, in such games actors often fail to coordinate on a payoff dominant equilibrium due to uncertainty. Thus, we discuss how uncertainty could be reduced along two options: one that concerns a change in the payoff structure of the game and another that concerns subjective probabilities.},

These risks include green and sustainable washing, the rebranding of financial flows without additionality, the disordered adjustment in the cost of capital spreads between industries. I argue that to reflect the actual industry and policy context as wells as to steer conceptual and applied practice sustainable finance should be today referred to as ``finance for sustainability''. To this extent, both its definition and implementing standards should make clear reference to the relevant sustainability dimensions (in particular in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement) and to the sectors or activities that positively contribute to these dimensions.},

  abstract = {A vanguard of insurers is adapting its business model to the realities of climate change. In many ways, insurers are still catching up both to mainstream science and to their customers, which, in response to climate change and energy volatility, are increasingly changing the way they construct buildings, transport people and goods, design products and produce energy. Customers, as well as regulators and shareholders, are eager to see insurers provide more products and services that respond to the ``greening'' of the global economy, expand their efforts to improve disaster resilience and otherwise be proactive about the climate change threat. Insurers are increasingly recognising the issue as one of ``enterprise risk management'' (ERM), one cutting across the domains of underwriting, asset management and corporate governance. Their responses are becoming correspondingly sophisticated. Based on a review of more than 300 source documents, plus a direct survey of insurance companies, we have identified 643 specific activities from 244 insurance entities from 29 countries, representing a 50 per cent year-over-year increase in activity. These entities collectively represent \$1.2 trillion in annual premiums and \$13 trillion in assets, while employing 2.2 million people. In addition to activities on the part of 189 insurers, eight reinsurers, 20 intermediaries and 27 insurance organisations, we identified 34 non-insurance entities that have collaborated in these efforts. Challenges and opportunities include bringing promising products and services to scale, continuing to identify and fill market and coverage gaps and identifying and confirming the veracity of green improvements. There is also need for convergence between sustainability and disaster resilience, greater engagement by insurers in adaptation to unavoidable climate changes and to clarify the role that regulators will play in moving the market. It has not yet been demonstrated how some insurance lines might respond to climate change and a number of market segments have not yet been served with a single green insurance product or service. As insurer activities obtain more prominence, they also will be subject to more scrutiny and expectations that they are not simply greenwashing.},

  abstract = {A rapid phase-out of unabated coal use is essential to limit global warming to below 2 {$^\circ$}C. This review presents a comprehensive assessment of coal transitions in mitigation scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement, using data from more than 1500 publicly available scenarios generated by more than 30 integrated assessment models. Our ensemble analysis uses clustering techniques to categorize coal transition pathways in models and bridges evidence on technological learning and innovation with historical data of energy systems. Six key findings emerge: First, we identify three archetypal coal transitions within Paris-consistent mitigation pathways. About 38\% of scenarios are `coal phase out' trajectories and rapidly reduce coal consumption to near zero. `Coal persistence' pathways (42\%) reduce coal consumption much more gradually and incompletely. The remaining 20\% follow `coal resurgence' pathways, characterized by increased coal consumption in the second half of the century. Second, coal persistence and resurgence archetypes rely on the widespread availability and rapid scale-up of carbon capture and storage technology (CCS). Third, coal-transition archetypes spread across all levels of climate policy ambition and scenario cycles, reflecting their dependence on model structures and assumptions. Fourth, most baseline scenarios---including the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)---show much higher coal dependency compared to historical observations over the last 60 years. Fifth, coal-transition scenarios consistently incorporate very optimistic assumptions about the cost and scalability of CCS technologies, while being pessimistic about the cost and scalability of renewable energy technologies. Sixth, evaluation against coal-dependent baseline scenarios suggests that many mitigation scenarios overestimate the technical difficulty and costs of coal phase-outs. To improve future research, we recommend using up-to-date cost data and evidence about innovation and diffusion dynamics of different groups of zero or low-carbon technologies. Revised SSP quantifications need to incorporate projected technology learning and consistent cost structures, while reflecting recent trends in coal consumption.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To support the data requirements of stakeholders, the Nickel Institute (NI) conducted a global life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to show, with indicators, the potential environmental impacts of the production of nickel and ferronickel from mine to refinery gate. A metal industry wide agreed approach on by-products and allocation was applied. Methods: Nine companies, comprising 19 operations, contributed data, representing 52~\% of global nickel metal production and 40~\% of global ferronickel production. All relevant pyro- and hydrometallurgical production routes were considered, across most major nickel-producing regions. Data from Russia, the biggest nickel-producing nation, was included; the Chinese industry did not participate. 2011 was chosen as reference year for data collection. The LCIA applied allocation of impacts of by-products using both economic and mass allocations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to further understand the relevance and impact of the different allocation approaches. Results and discussion: The primary extraction and refining steps are the main contributors to primary energy demand (PED) and global warming potential (GWP), contributing 60 and 70~\% to the PED for the production of 1~kg class I nickel and 1~kg nickel in ferronickel, respectively, and over 55~\% of the GWP for both nickel products. The PED for 1~kg class 1 nickel was calculated to be 147~MJ, whilst the PED for 1~kg nickel in ferronickel was calculated to be three times higher at 485~MJ. The main factors influencing energy demand in the metallurgical processes are ore grade and ore mineralogy. Sulphidic ore is less energy intensive to process than oxidic ore. Eighty-six percent of the production volume from class 1 nickel producers, in this study, is from sulphidic ore. All ferronickel was produced from oxidic ore. The LCIA results, including a sensitivity analysis of the impact of producers with higher and lower PED, reflect the influence of the production route on energy demand and on environmental impact categories. Conclusions: Conformant to relevant ISO standards, and backed-up with a technical and critical review, this LCIA quantifies the environmental impacts associated with the production of the main nickel products. With this study, a sound background dataset for downstream users of nickel has been provided. The Nickel Institute aims to update their data in the coming years to reflect upon changes in technology, energy efficiency, and raw material input.},

The standard model of own-payoff-maximization and the behavioral models of inequality aversion and equity theory predict different patterns of choices for rich and poor users under each condition. Experimental results are consistent with the predictions of the inequality-aversion model and clearly refute the predictions of equity theory. Importantly, inequality aversion appears to be motivating choices differently in the exogenous- and endogenous-provision conditions: under the regressive- and progressive-tax conditions, extraction choices are consistent with inequality aversion motives, whereas in the endogenous treatment, contribution decisions are consistent with inequality aversion but extraction choices are not.},

The standard model of own-payoff-maximization and the behavioral models of inequality aversion and equity theory predict different patterns of choices for rich and poor users under each condition. Experimental results are consistent with the predictions of the inequality-aversion model and clearly refute the predictions of equity theory. Importantly, inequality aversion appears to be motivating choices differently in the exogenous- and endogenous-provision conditions: under the regressive- and progressive-tax conditions, extraction choices are consistent with inequality aversion motives, whereas in the endogenous treatment, contribution decisions are consistent with inequality aversion but extraction choices are not.},

The concept of planetary boundaries evaluates whether the environmental loads from humans are within the carrying capacity of the environment at a global level, while the region-specific assessment of carrying capacities of freshwater consumption can complement the global-scale sustainability assessment by shedding light on regional sustainability. We show that 24\% of the total freshwater consumption exceeds the regional carrying capacities based on spatially and temporally explicit analysis (monthly data for around 11 000 watersheds). Although 19\% of the current total freshwater consumption is determined as "luxury consumption"beyond basic needs, approximately 60\% of the exceedance is attributed to basic needs of freshwater for sustaining human life. International trade alleviates the overall pressure on carrying capacity by approximately 4.8\% (18.9 billion m3) at a global level through virtual water trade; however, several producer countries demonstrate additional overconsumption beyond the regional carrying capacities, while importer countries that can do so mitigate overconsumption. Appropriate irrigation water management and the location of crop production are the keys to maintain our freshwater consumption levels within the regional carrying capacities on a global scale. However, measures that necessitate the consideration of watershed-specific environmental and economic conditions are desirable.},

This has been undertaken to assess and quantify the 'embodied water' of mineral products-a key aspect of sustainability (embodied water is the total water required to produce a good or service). At present, although the use of formal reporting protocols such as the global reporting initiative (GRI) is increasing, there are still critical weaknesses. Some key aspects to facilitate proper water accounting are not listed in sustainability reports, including the extent of recycled water used, mine site water inventories, the quality of various waters, and impacts on water resources. Based on the data compiled, there is wide variation in the water used for different mineral commodities as well as for the same commodity. There is little evidence for 'economies of scale' in base metals and bulk minerals, though for precious metals (gold, platinum), greater throughput does tend to lead to greater efficiency. For many mines, there is little evidence of improving efficiency over time, although some mines have made substantive improvements in reducing water consumed. The grade of ore being processed is clearly critical in understanding the embodied water of minerals, with declining ore grades leading to an increased chance of higher embodied water in the future. Given that many metals are declining in average ore grade, the sensitivity of embodied water to ore grade provides a major sustainability challenge for mining generally. In summary, the embodied water of minerals is clearly significant, and will likely gradually increase in the future, and so must be more completely accounted for to understand a fundamental aspect of sustainability and mining-that of water resources. {\copyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {The modern world is growing even more dependent on complex technology and infrastructure which need a variety of metals to function. The energy sector is perhaps one of the most crucial areas of this continual evolution of society's needs, with the rapid uptake in renewable energy technologies being a fundamental part of addressing global greenhouse gas emissions and climate change concerns. The principal technologies of renewable energy include solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and energy storage batteries, all of which are increasingly reliant on a complex array of metals which are rarely mined in their own right but are by-products to primary metals. For example, cadmium and indium are not mined by themselves but are instead extracted during the refining of zinc concentrates, or tellurium is extracted from copper refineries. Furthermore, the production of these specialty metals is often dominated by a select few countries or companies and, combined with their modest value and market size (especially compared to their primary cousins), this means that there are a lack of published studies and data. Although the lack of data or market dominance often raises concerns about possible supply risks, the reality is that there are abundant mineral resources known for all of the primary metals from which specialty metals are extracted. The future supply of metals and minerals already is and will be increasingly constrained by social and environmental issues, especially as the scale of modern mining is now so much greater than decades ago. This chapter reviews all of these key issues surrounding the need for an evergrowing suite of metals for future energy technologies, their current supply and associated key issues. There is indeed a strong case for optimism that the world can continue to work toward even greater uptake of renewable energy and international agreements such as the Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.},

  abstract = {The carbon balance of the land biosphere is the result of complex interactions between land, atmosphere and oceans, including climatic change, carbon dioxide fertilization and land-use change. While the land biosphere currently absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, this carbon balance might be reversed under climate and land-use change (`carbon balance reversal'). A carbon balance reversal would render climate mitigation much more difficult, as net negative emissions would be needed to even stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. We investigate the robustness of the land biosphere carbon sink under different socio-economic pathways by systematically varying climate sensitivity, spatial patterns of climate change and resulting land-use changes. For this, we employ a modelling framework designed to account for all relevant feedback mechanisms by coupling the integrated assessment model IMAGE with the process-based dynamic vegetation, hydrology and crop growth model LPJmL. We find that carbon balance reversal can occur under a broad range of forcings and is connected to changes in tree cover and soil carbon mainly in northern latitudes. These changes are largely a consequence of vegetation responses to varying climate and only partially of land-use change and the rate of climate change. Spatial patterns of climate change as deduced from different climate models, substantially determine how much pressure in terms of global warming and land-use change the land biosphere will tolerate before the carbon balance is reversed. A reversal of the land biosphere carbon balance can occur as early as 2030, although at very low probability, and should be considered in the design of so-called peak-and-decline strategies.},

  abstract = {All economies rely today on metal use either in the construction or energy sectors or in more advanced technology sectors. Nevertheless, not all countries have mining industries, which implies that these countries need to import primary metal concentrates and semi-finished goods containing metals to fulfill their final consumption. By importing these goods, they also import their associated environmental externalities. Considering the French metropolitan territory where mining industries are on hold since the 1990s, this study assesses the impacts on climate change of metals-related activities (i.e. mining, production and recycling) induced by the French final demand, as well as their share in the total French carbon footprint. The EXIOBASE v3.3 hybrid database is used to perform the assessment, showing that the metal sector represents 13\% of the total French carbon footprint. This contribution is mainly due to the ``iron and steel production'' activities that are linked to the ``construction'' and ``motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers'' goods consumed in France. The assessment also shows that France outsources 79\% of the metal sector GHG emissions induced by its consumption. 55\% of these emissions occur in the European Union and more than 17\% specifically in China. Therefore, despite metallic ores are pratically not anymore mined in France, the embodied metal on the French final demand indirectly generates large greenhouse gases emissions abroad (in particular CO2). This detailed overview can be used as support to policy-making, e.g. regarding actions on metal domestic production, trade and more generally supply chains, potentially key to reduce the share of metals in the French carbon footprint. Finally, three major rooms of improvement are identified to refine the assessment of the contribution of the metal sector to the whole environmental footprint of French consumption.},

In addition, the consequences of such practices on sustainable scores and money flows are studied. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 454 US equity SRMFs is studied. This paper uses panel regressions controlling for time and style fixed-effects. Findings: This study finds that 17.60\% of SRMF managers in the sample are engaged in style deviation practices. These practices positively impact the sustainable performance of SRMFs and negatively impact their financial performance. One effect offsets the other and they consequently do not affect money flows. Another finding is that only investors with lower portfolio sustainability scores do show return-chaser behaviour. Practical implications: This paper reveals that SRMF managers deviating from their stated financial style face a dilemma that is non-existent for their conventional peers that is style deviation practices affect financial and sustainable performance in opposing ways, whereas SRMF investor utility depends positively on both dimensions. The findings are not conclusive about the effectiveness of style deviation practices in attracting SRMF money flows. Social implications: SRMF industry has experienced tremendous growth in the past decade. The increased competition in this industry has led managers to strive to attract investors, sometimes by relying on irregular practices that enhance their portfolio results. Regulators should consider how to avoid such perverse behaviour with a view to improving mutual funds transparency. Originality/value: This is the first research that analyses style deviation practices and their consequences for the SRMF industry.},

Applying Coase's financial decision-making theory based on cost, revenues, and risks, the article analyzes literature and current developments of biodiversity finance and green finance to evaluate why financial decision-making is incentivized to ignore biodiversity risks and mostly fails to maximize biodiversity conservation or nature-positive finance. Based on the identified gaps, the article develops four principles to integrate biodiversity into financial decision-making: (1) regulation must set limits on nature's exploitation, as finance only values limited aspects of nature as ``bankable,'' while the destruction of other parts are without negative or positive value to the investor; (2) biodiversity-related financial risk evaluation needs focus on local risks due to the local nature of biodiversity impacts and dependencies (in comparison, e.g., to climate finance's global risks); (3) scale biodiversity finance utilizing its secondary benefits, particularly in conjunction with climate finance; (4) biodiversity finance development needs to be co-led and championed by financial decision-makers. This article contributes to the emerging literature on biodiversity finance and green finance for sustainable development with implications for policy makers and standard setters.},

  abstract = {Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Conventional regulatory reforms of the financial system focus on standard economic assumptions of self-interested, rational actors. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and similar financial failures highlight that there are limits to this approach. Instead we use a norm-based (or soft law) perspective to examine how the systemic problems underlying the GFC lay not so much in neo-classical economic assumptions of self-interest, but in unchecked financial innovation exploited by norms of buyer beware and ratings agency reliance among market participants. Fueled by sector-wide remuneration practices, these norms created information asymmetries that fundamentally undermined the integrity of the market. Research Findings/Insights: We present a model that highlights how investment banks, as professional service firms, have superior information to their clients. This presents an information asymmetry problem whereby they can exploit the market norm of caveat emptor (buyer beware) when developing innovative financial transactions. We propose a model highlighting how flawed financial innovation can lead to widespread, systemic problems of assessing and pricing risk because market participants can actively develop and promote flawed transactions. This problem is exacerbated where there is an over-reliance on credit ratings agencies (due to the high information and search costs facing buyers) and a reduced emphasis on director fiduciary duties in financial Special Purpose Entities. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Social norms that underpin financial markets are central to market regulation. Our approach provides a re-examination of the often unquestioned use of universal norms for differing market transactions in the financial sector. Researchers need to explore the interaction between social norms and market contexts (such as financial innovation) to better understand the behavior of financial markets. We contend that a mismatch between norms and market mechanisms can lead to significant unintended outcomes. Our approach of combining soft law (norms) and hard law (regulation) approaches to regulation provides added insights into agency, stewardship, and institutional theories. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators need to understand norms and financial market contexts to develop better legislative interventions. Specifically, differentiating between transaction types in financial markets will address the problems associated with information and search costs facing buyers of flawed financial innovation. We also provide proposals for policy makers seeking to embed accountability for risk taking across the key participants in the financial system to minimize market distortions in the majority of the financial sector. {\copyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The literature related to climate-economy modelling is already vast: apart from a very large number of models and an even larger number of applications, there already exist many good surveys comparing---inter alia---modelling frameworks, model assumptions and model results. The objective of this chapter is to provide a simple overview and organising scheme of this modelling world by delving into the characteristics of more than 60 individual IAMs towards describing the main ways in which certain classes or groups of climate-economy models differ from one another. In contrast to other more detailed or narrowly focused ``overviews'' and literature reviews, this analysis takes less for granted and aims at providing an initial understanding of generic model structures. After briefly discussing some principles of classification that can help organise this often daunting modelling world, the chapter offers descriptions and comparisons of the main classes of models.},

Very few previous studies have examined the final consumer of SRI profiled mutual funds. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to, in an exploratory manner, examine the impact of a number of pro-social, financial performance, and socio-demographic variables on SRI behavior in order to explain why investors choose to invest different proportions of their investment portfolio in SRI profiled funds. An ordinal logistic regression analysis on 528 private investors revealed that two of the three pro-social variables had a positive impact on how much the consumer invested in SRI profiled funds. Moreover, there was proof of a non-altruistic motive for investing in SRI as consumers who perceive that financial return of SRI is equal or better than "regular" mutual funds, invested a greater proportion of their portfolio in SRI profiled mutual funds. Furthermore, the results showed that women and better-educated investors were more likely to invest a greater proportion of their investment portfolio in SRI. Overall, the findings indicate that both financial perceptions and pro-social attitudes are connected to consumer investment in SRI. {\copyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The relationship between insurance, climate change and environmental threats has gained research attention. This study describes the interaction between insurance, climate change and environmental risk. Design/methodology/approach This study is a bibliometric analysis of the literature and assessed the current state of science. A total of 97 academic papers from top-level journals listed in the Scopus database are shortlisted. Findings The understanding of climate change, environmental risks and insurance is shaped and enhanced through the collaborative network maps of researchers. Their reach expands across different networks, core themes and streams, as these topics develop. Research limitations/implications Data for this study were generated from English-written journal articles listed in the Scopus database only; subsequently, this study was representative of high-quality papers published in the areas of climate change, environmental risks and insurance. Practical implications The results of this study can be useful to academic researchers to aid their understanding of climate change, environmental risks and insurance research development, to identify the current context and to develop a future research agenda. Social implications The findings of this study can improve the understanding of industry practitioners about climate change and global warming challenges, and how insurance can be used as a tool to address such challenges. Originality/value This study is a novel attempt. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to better understand climate change, environmental risks and insurance as a research topic by examining its evolution in an academic context through visualization, coupling and bibliometric analysis. This bibliometric study is unique in reviewing climate change literature and providing a future research agenda. Using bibliometric data, this study addressed the technical aspects and the value it adds to actual practice. Bibliometric indicators quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate emerging disciplinary progress in this topic.},

  abstract = {In this paper, life cycle assessment methodology has been used to assess the variations in water use associated with different metal production and processing routes and provide insights into the value derived from water usage in the minerals sector. Using water consumption data derived from the literature it has been shown that the 'cradle-to-gate' water consumption (or embodied water) for production of the various metals considered in the study ranged from 2.9 m3/t for steel up to 252 087 m3/t for gold. The results largely reflect the grade of the initial ore used to produce each metal, and can be approximated by the following equation: W= 167.7G-03039 where: W = embodied water (m3/t refined metal) G = grade of ore used to produce metal (per cent metal) The study showed that indirect water consumption in the metal production life cycle, in particular that due to electricity generation, can make a significant contribution to the embodied water value, eg aluminium production. When expressed in terms of m3/t ore, the results for all metals considered indicated that the embodied water is roughly, on average, three times the water consumption of the mining and concentration stage. It was also shown that the economic value per m3 of water consumed for the minerals industry exceeds that for the agricultural and industrial sectors, supporting the view that allocating water resources to the minerals industry has a strong underlying economic basis. Water reforms currently taking place in Australia aim to address issues such as competition for water access, reduced security of supply and increase in cost. Consequently the minerals industry, along with others, can be expected to come under increasing pressure to reduce fresh or raw water use and to integrate water use across sectors. While water recycling is an obvious candidate to help reduce water consumption in the minerals industry, issues such as water quality, among others, will influence the extent to which this can be achieved. In addition, wastewater volumes can be minimised using techniques such as pinch analysis to establish and use the minimum water requirement for the process. The use of dry or near-dry processing technologies, for which the demand for water is small or zero, may be a more radical solution to the water consumption problem; however, it is possible that the introduction of dry processing would bring with it a new set of problems, including dust.},

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology that can be used for such purposes to identify those parts of the metal production life cycle that have significant environmental impacts. LCA has been used by CSIRO Minerals to assess the "cradle-to-gate" environmental impacts of a number of metal production processes practised either currently or potentially in Australia. The metals considered included copper, nickel, aluminium, lead, zinc, steel, stainless steel and titanium, by both pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical routes in some instances. The environmental profile included greenhouse and acid rain gas emissions, solid waste emissions and gross energy consumption. The results for various metals are compared in this paper. New process technologies for primary metal production can be expected to reduce the environmental impacts of metal production, and estimates of likely reductions for technologies involving stainless steel, titanium and aluminium are also presented in this paper. {\copyright} 2006.},

The results showed that loading and hauling make the largest contributions to the total greenhouse gas emissions for the mining and processing of iron ore and bauxite. In the case of copper ore, the crushing and grinding steps make the largest contribution to the total greenhouse gas emissions for the production of copper concentrate. These results indicate that efforts to reduce the increased greenhouse gas emissions from mining and mineral processing, anticipated in the future as a result of falling ore grades and more finer-grained deposits, should focus on loading and hauling for iron ore and bauxite, while for copper ore the focus should be on grinding. There are a number of new and emerging technologies that could be expected to assist in this task, and these include high pressure grinding rolls and stirred mills for grinding, and further advances in diesel engine technology for loading and hauling applications.

Flotation and pressure oxidation were included prior to cyanidation for processing refractory ores. For a base case ore grade of 3.5 g Au/t ore, the life cycle-based environmental footprint of gold production was estimated to be approximately 200,000 GJ/t Au, 18,000 t CO 2e/t Au, 260,000 t water/t Au and 1,270,000 t waste solids/t Au for non-refractory ore. The embodied energy and greenhouse gas footprints were approximately 50\% higher with refractory ore due to the additional material and energy inputs and gold and silver losses associated with the additional processing steps required with this ore. The solid waste burden was based on an assumed strip ratio of 3 t waste rock/t ore, but this ratio varies considerably between mines, significantly influencing the estimated value of this impact. The environmental footprint of gold production (per tonne of gold produced) was shown to be several orders of magnitude greater than that for a number of other metals, largely due to the low grades of ore used for the production of gold compared to other metals. The mining and comminution stages made the greatest contribution to the greenhouse gas footprint of gold production, with electricity being the major factor, and being responsible for just over half of the greenhouse gas footprint. This result emphasises the need to focus on these stages in any endeavours to reduce the embodied energy and greenhouse gas footprints of gold production. However, the significance of the contribution of the mining and comminution stages to the environmental footprint also means that falling gold ore grades will have a major impact on the environmental profile, and this issue is examined in the paper. Some technological developments in gold ore processing that have the potential to reduce the environmental footprint of gold production are also discussed. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The methods available to calculate a water footprint of a product or process have developed significantly over the past several years. Recent methods recognise that there are two main impacts associated with water use: consumption and degradation, and these impacts can occur either directly at a production facility, or indirectly within a producer's supply chain. In this paper examples are provided showing how these methods can be applied to mining, mineral processing and metal production systems, with a particular focus on copper, gold and nickel production. Water footprinting methods can be used in a variety of ways. The water stress index of different areas can be used to benchmark sites operating in different regions and to understand the water supply risks facing major mineral and metal commodities. The process of preparing a water footprint of an operation can also reveal significant opportunities for water savings at individual sites. {\copyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The interactions of the mining industry with water resources are highly complex and site specific, with potential impacts to both hydrology and water quality occurring at all stages of a mine's life. A range of water management approaches are employed by the industry to mitigate the risks of adverse water impacts occurring. Consequently, the significant variability within the industry poses a range of challenges when attempting to quantify the water footprint of mining operations and mineral commodities. Methods for water footprinting have developed significantly over the past decade and have recently become aligned with life cycle assessment approaches. Despite these advances, relatively few studies have focused upon applying these methods within the mining and mineral processing industry. A range of limitations were identified that hinder the ability to conduct these types of studies. These limitations include: the availability of mine site water use data, inventory data for mining supply chains, the uncertainty of post-closure impacts, and the difficulty of accounting for cumulative impacts and extreme events (e.g. flooding, dam failures, etc.). The spatial resolution and data underpinnings of current water footprint impact characterisation factors also limits the ability to interpret results that may be generated. Overcoming these limitations, through methodological development and data collection efforts, represents a significant opportunity to improve our understanding of the mining industry's water use and impacts. Beyond this, several key opportunities for more widespread use of mine site water footprint assessments were identified, including: to aid the benchmarking of water performance in the mining industry, to improve the quality of cross-sectoral assessments of water use, to assess the indirect impacts of competing technologies, and to provide improved water use disclosures within corporate sustainability reports.},

This lack of sophistication prevents formation of knowledge required to answer key questions pertaining to future mining output, the amount of companion metals that can be supplied and the investments and lead times needed to fulfil future metal demand. To address this, we introduce the Primary Exploration, Mining and Metal Supply Scenario (PEMMSS) model, which allows for mine-by-mine modelling with full regionalisation and linkages to geological deposit types. PEMMSS allows for the assessment of required rates of mineral deposit discovery, mine development and co-product recovery overtime for a range of socio-economic and sustainable development linked primary material demand scenarios. The model can be calibrated using mineral resource grade, tonnage and density probability distribution functions for regions and deposit types to stochastically model scenarios for future greenfield discoveries and understand uncertainities. Applying PEMMSS will facilitate improved understanding of how future urbanisation across the globe and low-carbon transitions will translate into altered requirements for the exploration and primary mineral and metal supply sectors and their associated environmental impacts. A hypothetical case study is presented for a four co-product commodity system to highlight potential model behaviours and key drivers of model sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The International Aluminium Institute's (IAI) aim was to publish life cycle inventory (LCI) data for use by life cycle assessment (LCA) practitioners through professional databases. The need to provide robust data stems from the increasing application of LCA as a tool for making material and design choices and the importance for representative, up-to-date information to underpin such studies. In addition to this, the institute aimed to evaluate the significance of potential environmental impacts, based on the LCI results, against a defined set of impact categories which can be tracked over time. Methods: Key environmental data collected as part of the IAI's long-running industry surveys provided the foundation for the life cycle inventory. In order to evaluate the environmental impact, direct input and output data for primary aluminium production were supplemented with background data for indirect processes available in GaBi version 6 (PE International, 2013b). A cradle-to-gate model was constructed with two distinct datasets, global (GLO) and global minus China (rest of world (RoW)). A partial life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) was completed using the models, and the following six CML (2001--Nov 2010) midpoint environmental impact categories were reported: acidification potential, depletion of fossil energy resources, eutrophication potential, global warming potential, ozone depletion potential and photo-oxidant creation potential. Water scarcity footprint of primary aluminium (Buxmann et al. in this issue) was also included. Results and discussion: The results indicated that the largest greenhouse gas contributions were attributed to the alumina refining and electrolysis unit processes in both datasets, with electricity and thermal energy, being the major contributing factors to these higher values. The energy intensive nature of primary aluminium production means energy supply can significantly influence the overall environmental impact. Electricity production was found to contribute between 25 \% and 80 \% to all impact category indicator results, with higher values in the global dataset, a result of the inclusion of Chinese energy data and the increased share of coal-based electricity consumption that it represents. Conclusions: The global aluminium industry remains dedicated to transparent reporting of its environmental impacts and ensuring that up-to-date, representative LCI data is available. Development of suitable methodologies for new indicators will be required to ensure that the industry continues to report accurately all its relevant impacts. Additionally, with the increased importance of Chinese aluminium production, inclusion of foreground data from Chinese production would further enhance the dataset from which the global impacts of aluminium production are assessed from cradle to gate.},

  abstract = {We have assembled extensive information on the cradle-to-gate environmental burdens of 63 metals in their major use forms, and illustrated the interconnectedness of metal production systems. Related cumulative energy use, global warming potential, human health implications and ecosystem damage are estimated by metal life cycle stage (i.e., mining, purification, and refining). For some elements, these are the first life cycle estimates of environmental impacts reported in the literature. We show that, if compared on a per kilogram basis, the platinum group metals and gold display the highest environmental burdens, while many of the major industrial metals (e.g., iron, manganese, titanium) are found at the lower end of the environmental impacts scale. If compared on the basis of their global annual production in 2008, iron and aluminum display the largest impacts, and thallium and tellurium the lowest. With the exception of a few metals, environmental impacts of the majority of elements are dominated by the purification and refining stages in which metals are transformed from a concentrate into their metallic form. Out of the 63 metals investigated, 42 metals are obtained as coproducts in multi output processes. We test the sensitivity of varying allocation rationales, in which the environmental burden are allocated to the various metal and mineral products, on the overall results. Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to further investigate the stability of our results. This analysis is the most comprehensive life cycle comparison of metals to date and allows for the first time a complete bottom-up estimate of life cycle impacts of the metals and mining sector globally. We estimate global direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 at 3.4 Gt CO2-eq per year and primary energy use at 49 EJ per year (9.5\% of global use), and report the shares for all metals to both impact categories. {\copyright} 2014 Nuss, Eckelman.},

Environmental economists studying the topic draw on diverse scholarly traditions and may not have the same phenomenon in mind when using the concept. For example, social norms may refer to common, but not necessarily socially approved, behaviors; to internalized ethical rules; or to one of several equilibria in a coordination game. I first discuss some of the definitions used in the environmental economics literature. Then, I outline a simple framework for analysis of voluntary contributions to public goods. Using this framework, I illustrate differences and similarities between altruism, moral norms, and social norms and discuss implications for environmental policies. In particular, when a social norm represents one of several stable equilibria, policy can potentially invoke abrupt and dramatic behavioral changes.},

Also, PA practitioners internationally may find the case study useful in addressing the challenge of insufficient funding for PAs under their care and control. The paper provides the Theory of Change (ToC) as a mechanism for the sustainable financing of the PA estate in NSW, identifying six pathways to change: government support, institutional effectiveness, appropriate business model, strategic planning and innovation, communication and advocacy, and collaboration and partnerships. It demonstrates how the success of each pathway depends on a suite of enabling conditions which help to dismantle the impediments to the sustainable financing of the PA estate. The ToC is intended to guide actions to address the sustainable financing of the PA estate and to achieve the overall impact of the effective management of PAs with respect to conservation and other aligned objectives. The ToC presented in the paper is focused on NSW, however it considers policy and management implications and lessons from the case study that can be applied to PAs in an international context.},

As a strategy of risk management, it emphasises peace of mind, financial recompense and the swift restoration of a `business as usual' status for civil, social and commercial life. Yet despite the contribution of insurance to risk management, the synergies with progressive or adaptive articulations of resilience are not sufficiently explicated. This paper explores the fundamental contradictions of insurance as a form of resilience through a study of flood risk management. It demonstrates how insurance regimes serve to structurally embed risky behaviour and inhibit change after detrimental events. As such, transformative interpretations of resilience conflict with the long-standing principles and operational norms of insurance that privilege normality. The paper concludes that, despite its currency within resilience discourses, insurance is maladaptive and that insurance regimes reinforce exposure and vulnerability through underwriting a return to the `status-quo' rather than enabling adaptive behaviour.},

  abstract = {How students go about studying, including the learning activities that students engage in both during and between classes, is not easily understood. Previous research indicates that critical student features, such as approaches to learning and decisions of how to organise studying activities, develop in bidirectional interactions between personal and learning environmental factors. However, attempts to influence students' studying activities in certain directions by manipulating the learning environment often prove unsuccessful. A deeper analysis of the student perspective is needed, since students' subjective perceptions of the learning environment to a great extent will influence their individual ways of going about studying and learning. In particular, we need to clarify which aspects steer students towards focusing on certain studying activities in a particular course context. This study aimed at elaborating the student perspective of the process of selection of studying activities. It did this by searching for similarities in references to factors perceived as guiding this process among students representing very different combinations of approaches to learning. Students' approaches to learning were evaluated with the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) in two successive psychology introductory courses (N~=~261). A random (N~=~5) and a purposive (N~=~6) student sample was then selected and interviewed. Seven of the students also took part in follow-up interviews six months later. The qualitative analysis aimed at mapping and extracting similarities in students' perceptions of, and dealing with, the selection of studying activities. Despite considerable differences in students' approaches to learning and reported studying activities, all students interviewed referred to a common set of reference points perceived as guiding their ways of studying, i.e. their perception of (1) previous studying experiences, (2) course recommendations, (3) learning outcomes, (4) assessment demands and (5) time and effort spent on studying. We suggest that students' selection of studying activities may be seen as a process of negotiation based on input from certain reference points. In the course context under study, the targeting process resulted in a general homogenisation of studying activities and permitted students to feel they were studying efficiently. Although possible generalisation of the results remains to be investigated, it is suggested that understanding students' perceptions of reference points and general understanding of the targeting process could contribute to a better grasp of how student factors, course contexts and students' perceptions of these, interact.},

Here we propose a conceptual framework for how to define and develop a set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for use within the scenario framework. We define SSPs as reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate policies. We introduce the concept of a space of challenges to adaptation and to mitigation that should be spanned by the SSPs, and discuss how particular trends in social, economic, and environmental development could be combined to produce such outcomes. A comparison to the narratives from the scenarios developed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) illustrates how a starting point for developing SSPs can be defined. We suggest initial development of a set of basic SSPs that could then be extended to meet more specific purposes, and envision a process of application of basic and extended SSPs that would be iterative and potentially lead to modification of the original SSPs themselves.},

This study attempts to identify factors influencing Generation Y's (Gen-Y) intention to adopt socially responsible investment. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) framework is adopted and constructs which encompass attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are incorporated to examine how these variables sequentially influence the adoption of socially responsible investment. More importantly, the socially responsible consumption, as well as perceived moral obligation are also included utilizing developing an extended theory of planned behaviour research framework. The data was collected through a survey, employing a self-administered questionnaire using a 6-point Likert Scale among 390 respondents in Klang Valley. Findings show that all hypotheses are supported, except for the relationship between subjective norms and the adoption towards socially responsible investment (SRI). The findings provide useful information to the providers of investment products and services, especially in expanding their market towards promoting socially responsible investment particularly among Gen-Y.},

We ask how corporations can become sustainability leaders, when constrained by multiple barriers to collaboration for biosphere stewardship. We describe how scientists motivated, inspired and engaged with ten of the world's largest seafood companies, in a collaborative process aimed to enable science-based and systemic transformations (2015--2021). CEOs faced multiple industry crises in 2015 that incentivized novel approaches. New scientific insights, an~invitation to collaborate, and a bold vision of transformative change towards ocean stewardship, created new opportunities and direction. Co-creation of solutions resulted in new knowledge and trust, a joint agenda for action, new capacities, international recognition, formalization of an organization, increased policy influence, time-bound goals, and convergence of corporate change. Independently funded scientists helped remove barriers to cooperation, provided means for reflection, and guided corporate strategies and actions toward ocean stewardship. By 2021, multiple individuals exercised leadership and the initiative had transitioned from preliminary and uncomfortable conversations, to a dynamic, operational organization, with capacity to perform global leadership in the seafood industry. Mobilizing transformational agency through learning, collaboration, and innovation represents a cultural evolution with potential to redirect and accelerate corporate action, to the benefit of business, people and the planet.},

Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth's climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions (STIs) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements (STEs). STEs are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The STIs that could trigger the tipping of STE subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation (STE1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities (STE2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels (STE3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels (STE4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement (STE5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions (STE6, information feedbacks). Our research reveals important areas of focus for larger-scale empirical and modeling efforts to better understand the potentials of harnessing social tipping dynamics for climate change mitigation.},

Current estimates suggest that at least 30 energy transition minerals and metals (ETMs) form the material base for the energy transition. The inventory of ETMs indicates a high level of intersectionality with territories less impacted by the historic forces of industrialization. To identify the current global footprint, 5,097 ETM projects were geo-located against indicators for indigeneity, human modification of land, food production, water risk, conflict, as well as capacity measures for project permitting, consultation and consent. Study results differentiate ETMs to improve visibility over linkages between technology, resources and sustainability objectives. Our analysis reveals that more than half of the ETM resource base is located on or near the lands of Indigenous and peasant peoples, two groups whose rights to consultation and free prior informed consent are embedded in United Nations declarations. Transitioning the global energy system to renewables will likely expand energy transition minerals and metals (ETMs) projects to sensitive territories. Across 5,097 projects globally, greater than half of the ETM resource base appears to be located on or near the lands of Indigenous and peasant peoples whose rights to consultation are embedded in United Nations declarations.},

This descriptive analytic study compared levels of critical thinking among senior nursing students (N=147) in two educational programs, one of which used a problem-based learning (PBL) model while the other used a traditional model. The California critical thinking disposition inventory (CCTDI) was used as a data collection tool. Comparisons between the groups were made using t-test analysis. There was a significant difference (p{$<$}0.05) between the critical thinking disposition scores of the seniors in the PBL school and those in the school implementing the traditional model. Analysis of sub-scale scores showed significant differences in truth-seeking and open-mindedness. These findings add to the evidence that the active and self-directed nature of PBL encourages students' ability to think critically, be tolerant of the ideas of others and evaluate conflicting information before reaching a conclusion.},

  abstract = {In the early 2000s, the sustainable seafood movement put forward the concept of fishery improvement projects (FIP), a structured multi-stakeholder approach to address environmental challenges in a fishery and aims to use the power of the market to incentivize change. The intent of the FIP model is to allow fisheries that currently do not meet the MSC standard to maintain market access while working on credible improvements. As such, FIPs have become a widely promoted approach to sustainable fisheries and have proliferated around the globe. Based on recent research assessing the impact of FIPs and testing various FIP attributes and their link to FIP performance, it seems that the FIP model may be delivering on its promise overall. However, the impact of FIP are at best based correlation rather than causation, with only few FIP attributes having been measured consistently over a significant period of time. In this theoretical contribution, we bring attention to one attribute of FIPs: the structure of their social network and its implication for social capital and successful collective action. We start by describing FIPs as projects located at the intersection of environmental governance networks and value chain network governance. Secondly, we demonstrate FIPs as complex social networks and the link between network attributes and FIP progress through the concept of social capital. Thirdly, we present the method of social network analysis and relevant network attributes to understand and characterize how FIPs work better. Finally, we suggest opportunities for further research and integration of this approach in planning and designing FIPs. Through this work, we wish to bring attention to one type of FIP attributes that is currently not explicitly being taken into account to current FIP practitioner and researchers.

Findings from literature provide some insights but do not yield a comprehensive answer as to why private investors refrain from sustainable investing. Interviews with wealthy private investors led us to identify a generally high interest in sustainable investing and dominant barriers that prevent actual engagement. Barriers are the perception of high volatility within sustainable investments in combination with, first, a short investment time horizon and, second, recent financial losses. Third, we find that investment advisors withhold required information from their clients. We suggest a decision-making framework that facilitates a better understanding of the engagement of private investors in sustainable investing and outline avenues for future research and implications for practitioners.},

The objective scenario of the PNIEC expects to reach a renewable share in the power system of 74\% by 2030. In this context, three contributions are developed: i) providing an analysis of how Spain is facing the energy transition; ii) conceptualizing the link between an hourly energy model (EnergyPLAN) and a yearly integrated assessment model (MEDEAS); and iii) proposing a transparent policy agenda for the Spanish benchmarking in line with the official report. The results clarify the decreasing role such technologies as the combined heat and power facilities, as well as the pressure of biomass in Spain. Coherency in translating common variables in the energy chain of IAMs to the energy model is effectively reflected in the tables as an output of the research. Positive conclusions are found for Spain. The commitment of 74\% might well be completed and the Spanish economy could run with a 100\% renewable energy system by 2050, with requirements of sixteen and six times more installed capacity of solar-PV and wind onshore, respectively, by 2050 related to 2017.},

In our era, the paradigm oftheory is pure mathematics, that has no obvious application topractical problems of, e.g., engineering. As well, theoretical physicssometimes has a tenuous relation to confirming/disconfirmingexperimentation. At the other end of the spectrum is craft, forexample, carpentry, which is so enmeshed in material application thatit resists any general explanation but must be learned by practice. Asa consequence, theory and practice even seem irreconcilable. Outsideof modern science, there is sometimes skepticism about the relevanceof theory to practice because it is thought that theory is conductedat so great a remove from the facts, the province of practice, that itcan lose touch with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concreteexperience might be all we need. Finally, if the practical is widenedto include more than the way we manipulate the physical world but alsothe way we lead our lives, the relation between theory and practicehas another problematic aspect. Within science, theory strives for avalue-free view of reality. As a consequence, scientific theory cannottell us how things should be or how to lead our lives. This contrastpresents another aspect of the difference between theory and practice;pure theory is removed from ethical investigation and the practice ofliving requires it.},

  abstract = {The use of biodiversity offsets as a means to mitigate environmental damage whilst also accommodating for urban developer interests is becoming an increasingly popular policy mechanism. However, biodiversity offsets are not without their criticisms, and financial offsets have gained a reputation for allowing developers to buy their way out of responsibility for habitat restoration. Despite this, economic theory suggests that such economic instruments would also provide an incentive to reduce environmental damage as well as financing subsequent restoration activities. Observing the effects of these incentives on potential environmental damage are difficult, as usually what is apparent is only the final development proposal. Such an opportunity arose, however, through observing developer behaviour using an online planning tool developed by a local council in Southeast Queensland. The planning tool allows experimentation with different land clearing options and estimates the associated financial offset requirement of each. Analysis of successive applications of the planning tool from July 2015 to March 2017 suggest that developers alter their plans given the need to compensate for environmental damage. Here we show that, over the period of the data, the potential environmental damage from urban development was reduced by more than 55 per cent. Hence, as expected from economic theory, the financial offsets requirement economically incentivises developers' decisions, which in turn leads to reduced environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {The EC Raw Materials System Analysis (MSA) was carried out in 2015 for 28 materials. The MSA study investigates the flows of materials through the EU economy in terms of entry into the EU, flows through the economy, stock accumulation, and end-of-life management, e.g., through disposal or recovery in the EU-28. The MSA study is a follow-up of the ``Study on Data Needs for a Full Raw Materials Flow Analysis'' , launched by the European Commission in 2012 within the context of the European Raw Materials Initiative's (RMI) strategy. This strategy, which is a part of the Europe 2020's strategy for smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, aims at securing and improving access to raw materials for the EU. The MSA is a key building block of the European Union Raw Materials Knowledge Base (EURMKB). MSAs are an important data provider for a variety of raw material policy knowledge needs, as also reflected in the Raw Materials Information System (RMIS). The RMIS aims to support the broad range of EU policy knowledge needs of, e.g., the EU Raw Materials (RM) Scoreboard, EU Critical Raw Materials (CRM) assessment, and EU trade negotiations. In addition, it also aims to support broader coordination beyond these needs of other EU level data and information on raw materials. For both of these EUKBRM/RMIS roles, MSA is a vital backbone. The MSA data sets contain key, material specific data and information that will support the development of a database for the RMIS. However, currently only 28 MSA studies exist (mostly for CRMs) which are quickly becoming outdated. So far, no MSA studies exist for some of the major metals (e.g., iron, copper, aluminium, zinc, or nickel) which are important to the EU economy, e.g., due to the large quantities in which find use as well as due to their use in special application, e.g., as alloying elements. Against this background, this report presents, firstly, detailed MSA studies for aluminium (Al), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) and discusses, secondly, possibilities for future MSA update and maintenance in the RMIS. Overall, the results show that the EU-28 has a well-established industrial chain for all the three metals covering the major value chain steps (from extraction to end-of-life). However, modest natural deposits make the region strongly dependent on imports to meet the domestic demand of primary material. Only a small fraction of total primary metal input to processing in the EU-28 is supplied from domestic extraction ranging from 10\% (Al) to 13\% (Fe). Demand-supply dynamics and product lifetime determine the accumulation of materials as in-use stocks and scrap generation at end-of-life. Iron, aluminium, and copper are used in large quantities (compared to other metals) and their major application segments have relatively long in-use lifetimes (e.g., 50-75 years for building and construction). In-use stock for the three metals in EU-28 were estimated at about 5,300 Tg for iron (or around 10 t per capita), 132 Tg for aluminium (around 260 kg per capita), 73 Tg for copper (around 140 kg per capita). A consolidated recycling industry supplements primary supply of aluminium, copper and iron with inputs from secondary sources (id est, new scrap and old scrap). In particular, old scrap recycling performance attests respectable end-of-life recycling rates (EOL-RR) for the three metals (id est, 69\% aluminium, 61\% copper, 75\% iron), but they are still far from ``perfect'' recycling. In addition, not all old scrap collected for recycling is processed in the EU-28, with the region being a net-exporter of secondary material. Material loss in products at end-of-life and net-exports of secondary material forms constraint the closure of material cycles and prevent the implementation of a circular economy in the EU-28 requiring the adoption of resource efficiency strategies priority. Because of its system-wide perspective on raw materials issues (encompassing all life-cycle stages of a raw material), the MSA provides an overarching data structure that could be based inside the RMIS database (DB) core to collect, store, and provide data also for other policy knowledge needs (id est, EU CRM assessment, Circular Economy Monitoring, Trade, Minventory, RM Scoreboard). Flows/stocks parameters of the MSA can also be important to satisfy knowledge needs that may arise as a result of future policy needs, e.g., through resilience, determining urban stocks, and other emerging issues. Equally, complete MSAs can help in the quality assurance of the underlying mass balance/data and increasing harmonization of the various data sources -- which cannot be guaranteed if only a partial picture exists. Results from an assessment of data overlaps between MSA and other policy-related outputs show that current policy knowledge needs often require data on various flows related to the early stages of a raw material's life-cycle. For example, a total of 12 flows (out of 40 in total) of the MSA are also required for the 2017 CRM assessment. Data on secondary raw materials are essential for current circular economy monitoring, but generally difficult to obtain without MSAs. Possibilities for MSA update and maintenance range from partial data updates (harvesting data synergies with current policy-related outputs, e.g., the CRM assessment, Scoreboard, and Trade module in RMIS) to carrying out full/systematic MSAs for most candidate materials of the CRM assessment (through European Commission (EC) internal research projects and outsourcing via external contracts).},

But the problem frame also rests on a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these assumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge -- reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2{$^\circ$}C -- violates these assumptions. Climate change requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such prohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The main barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and institutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more effectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.},

The methods and algorithms of MFA have improved over the last few years, but a flexible platform that integrates recent modeling advances such as simultaneous consideration of the product, component, material and chemical element levels, lifetime models, and uncertainty treatment is not available. There is also no versatile data format for exchanging data between projects. This lack of research infrastructure is detrimental to scientific progress. To fill that gap, we propose a novel industrial ecology community model for MFA. The Open Dynamic Material Systems Model (ODYM) is an open source framework for material systems modeling programmed in Python. The description of systems, processes, stocks, flows, and parameters is object-based, which facilitates the development of modular software and testing routines for individual model blocks. ODYM MFA models can handle any depth of flow and stock specification: products, components, sub-components, materials, alloys, waste, and chemical elements can be traced simultaneously. ODYM features a new data structure for material flow analysis; all input and output data are stored in a standardized file format and can thus be exchanged across projects. It also comes with an extended library for dynamic stock modeling. We present the features, design principles, software, and data structure of ODYM, describe its main methods and functions, and give an outlook on current and future applications.},

  abstract = {Aluminum is an energy-intensive material that is typically used as an alloy. The environmental impacts caused by its production can potentially be spread out over multiple uses through repeated recycling loops. However, inter-alloy contamination can limit the circularity of aluminum, which highlights the importance of analyzing prospective stock dynamics of aluminum at an alloy and alloying element level to inform a more sustainable management of this resource. A dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) of aluminum alloys was developed in line with the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) framework to generate consistent scenarios of the evolution of aluminum stocks and flows from 2015 to 2100 covering 11 economic sectors in 5 world regions. A sector-specific and bottom-up modeling approach was developed. Results show no saturation of global stock per capita before 2100, reaching a range between 200 and 400 kg per capita according to different socioeconomic scenarios. For the business-as-usual scenario, the global annual inflow rises to 100 Mt in 2050 and peaks at 130 Mt in 2090, showing a saturation in total stock. Electricity-sector demand has the highest relative growth over the century, while building and construction demand saturates and decreases from 2090. No major mismatch between inflows and outflows of aluminum alloy is observed. This means that with appropriate dismantling and sorting, changes in alloy demand would not limit the implementation of a closed-loop aluminum industry. This study demonstrates the advantages of combining detailed MFAs and SSPs, both for greater consistency in circular economy modeling and for furthering scenario development efforts.

  abstract = {Summary: Water consumption related to the life cycle of metals is seldom reported, even though mines are often situated in very dry regions. In this study we quantified the life cycle consumption of groundwater and fresh surface water (blue water footprint [WFblue]) for the extraction and production of high-grade copper refined from both a copper sulfide ore and a copper oxide ore in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Where possible, we used company-specific data. The processes for extracting copper from the two types of ore are quite different from each other, and the WFblue of the sulfide ore refining process is 2.4 times higher than that of the oxide ore refining process (i.e., 96 cubic meters per metric ton [tonne] of copper versus 40 cubic meters per tonne of copper). Most of the water consumption (59\% of WFblue) in the sulfide ore process occurred at the concentrator plant, via seepage, accumulation, and also by evaporation. In the oxide ore process, the main user of water is the heap-leaching process, with 45\% of WFblue. The crushing and agglomeration operations, electrowinning cells, and solution pools are also significant contributors to the total consumption of water in the oxide ore process. Most of the water consumed in the oxide ore process was lost to evaporation. The WFblue of the oxide ore process can be reduced by preventing water evaporation and using more sophisticated devices during irrigation of the leaching heaps. The WFblue of the sulfide ore refining process can be reduced by improving water recovery (i.e., reducing seepage, accumulation, and evaporation) from the tailings dam at the concentrator plant. Using seawater in the production of copper is also a promising option to reduce the WFblue by up to 62\%. {\copyright} 2013 by Yale University.},

In terms of averages, energy use was higher for HMS (yearly average of between 0.90 -- 2.95 GJ/t valuable heavy mineral (VHM)) compared to ilmenite-dominant hard-rock mining (yearly average of between 0.21 -- 0.49 GJ/t ilmenite) and Ti-slag production required between {$\sim$}10 -- 14 GJ/t of saleable product (including titanium slag and pig-iron). Emissions from ilmenite-dominant hard rock mining produced {$\sim$}0.01 t CO2e/t ilmenite concentrate while HMS mining produced 0.07-0.38 t CO2e/t of VHM; emissions from beneficiating ilmenite into Ti-slag add significantly to this (0.62-1.21 t CO2e/t of saleable product, weighted by value). Overall, hard-rock mining operations consumed {$<$}5 kL/t ilmenite concentrate while HMS consumed 10-26 kL/t VHM. On the other hand, beneficiating hard-rock ilmenite into slag increases water-use by {$\sim$}220 kL/t of saleable product. Finally, in terms of land use, it was determined that an average of 4.3 ha per 1 Mt of ore was disturbed in HMS operations (no data was available for hard-rock operations). While average results comparing HMS, hard-rock and beneficiated products were broadly comparable to existing LCA literature, data used in LCA literature is not consistent with specific sites and using generalized data to infer site-specific data will often lead to erroneous estimates. These observations taken together are particularly important to downstream purchasers, as well as the investment community who do not fund entire industries, but fund and back specific projects; the decision made on which site or company to invest in is increasingly determined by environmental, social and governance (ESG) related factors. This paper not only provides quantitative indications of these factors for Ti/Zr production, but also guidance for improving sustainability reporting in the industry. An improvement in the quality, quantity and consistency in this data, as this paper explains, will allow for greater information to guide investment and ESG outcomes for Ti/Zr industries.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in research literature on the challenges of interconnected, compound, interacting, and cascading risks. These concepts are becoming ever more central to the resilience debate. They aggregate elements of climate change adaptation, critical infrastructure protection, and societal resilience in the face of complex, high-impact events. However, despite the potential of these concepts to link together diverse disciplines, scholars and practitioners need to avoid treating them in a superficial or ambiguous manner. Overlapping uses and definitions could generate confusion and lead to the duplication of research effort. This article gives an overview of the state of the art regarding compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks. It is intended to help build a coherent basis for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The main objective is to propose a holistic framework that highlights the complementarities of the four kinds of complex risk in a manner that is designed to support the work of researchers and policymakers. This article suggests how compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks could be used, with little or no redundancy, as inputs to new analyses and decisional tools designed to support the implementation of the SFDRR. The findings can be used to improve policy recommendations and support tools for emergency and crisis management, such as scenario building and impact trees, thus contributing to the achievement of a system-wide approach to resilience.},

While many investors are drawn to the concept, there are hurdles that prevent them from actually applying it. In the literature, both the fear of an underperformance and the lack of easily accessible standards have been addressed at large. From consulting experience, we highlight another problem: Especially with negative screening, some criteria are apt to result in fruitless and fundamental discussions that have led to the abortion of many SRI implementation processes especially in smaller organizations. This results from the fact that negative or exclusion criteria are drawn from different contexts and origins and may not be applicable to all investors. We thus propose a simple but differentiated system of criteria that is linked to the Sustainable Development Goals and can be used without the requirement of SRI professionals, giving small institutional investors a pragmatic and easy access to SRI implementation.},

Avoiding impacts is seen by many as the most certain and effective way of managing harm to biodiversity, and its position as the first stage of the mitigation hierarchy indicates that it should be prioritized ahead of other stages. However, despite an abundance of legislative and voluntary requirements, there is often a failure to avoid impacts. We discuss reasons for this failure and outline some possible solutions. We highlight the key roles that can be played by conservation organizations in cultivating political will, holding decision makers accountable to the law, improving the processes of impact assessment and avoidance, building capacity, and providing technical knowledge. A renewed focus on impact avoidance as the foundation of the mitigation hierarchy could help to limit the impacts on biodiversity of large-scale developments in energy, infrastructure, agriculture and other sectors.},

This analysis considers the adequacy of insurance (in its broadest sense) responses to climate risk. This paper provides novel critiques of insurance system responses to climate change and of the attendant political economy perspective on the relationship between insurance and climate change. A complex adaptive systems (CAS) analysis suggests that ecologically effective (i.e. strong) mitigation is the only viable approach to manage medium- and long-term climate risk -- for the insurance system itself and for human societies more widely. In contrast, we find that even the most substantial insurance system responses to date are generally adaptive and weakly mitigative. This analysis extends an earlier political economy perspective that explains the limitations of insurance system responses to climate change, but provides little guidance to the ecological implications of such responses. As such, this paper raises questions about the ongoing viability of the insurance system, and hence about the many aspects of human societies globally reliant on the insurance system as their primary risk governance tool. We conclude that the CAS approach provides new insights, which could prompt insurance system evolution in support of effective climate risk governance.

I develop a conceptual framework to improve the effectiveness of SRI policy-making. The first part of the framework comprises a transmission mechanism which emphasizes the role of SRI as a driver for sustainable development. The second part is a model of the individual decision for or against SRI. The framework suggests that low SRI demand is a case of behavioral market failure, and that nudging is a suitable tool for dismantling behavioral barriers to SRI. A specific example of smart choice architecture is used to illustrate the framework's potential in the design of an SRI nudge. Assuming the nudge stands up to the rigors of empirical testing, it may well provide a feasible alternative for policy-makers.},

  abstract = {It is hotly debated today whether the reduction of tropical deforestation should be supported by a mechanism within the Convention for Climate Change. This mechanism, known as ``avoided deforestation,'' would benefit developing countries that voluntarily reduce their deforestation rates, thereby generating at least two positive impacts: (a) an increase in the financial resources available to curb tropical deforestation, with expected positive side effects on biodiversity conservation, the environmental services provided by these forests, and sustainable development as a whole; and (b) a greater effectiveness of the global fight against climate change, because tropical deforestation contributes extensively to world carbon emissions. Several proposals were designed for such a mechanism, yet their implementation poses significant methodological problems: first, sophisticated tools available to measure the reduction of emissions might be ineffective when combined with baselines on a national level; secondly, baselines calculated ex ante lack accuracy because of insufficient knowledge concerning the direct and underlying causes of deforestation; thirdly, baselines calculated ex post lack legitimacy because they only refer to past trends; and fourthly, it is challenging to relate a reduction in deforestation rates to public policy options in the host country.Drawing lessons from our analysis of the methodological problems for the implementation of the mechanism, we recommend not promoting any mechanism based on financial rewards for an assumed voluntary reduction of national tropical deforestation rates. Two reasons justify our perspective: not only would the mechanism probably generate fake reductions (``hot air''), but undesirable side effects---detailed in this paper---would also appear. Instead, we encourage industrialized countries to better use already existing multi- and bilateral instruments, which focus on the correction of governance deficiencies in countries home to tropical forests. It is also necessary to focus on the suppression of ``perverse incentives'' from public policies in tropical countries.},

Complexity theory reveals that decentralized governance architecture is required for firms to absorb competently the increased intricacies, variety of variables, and objectives introduced by CSR. The current predominant form of centralized governance based on command-and-control hierarchies copes with complexities by reducing data inputs. This approach results in firms reducing their objectives, concerns, and insights about CSR. Firms with a decentralized ``network'' form of governance architecture are used to illustrate how the data inputs of each manager can be reduced through the decomposition of decisionmaking labor to improve the capability of the firm to intelligently absorb and manage complexity. Network governance also introduces a division of powers with stakeholders to facilitate information flow and strengthen incentives to manage the enterprise to enhance both shareholder value and CSR.},

  abstract = {Efforts to assess risks to the financial system associated with climate change are growing. These commonly combine the use of integrated assessment models to obtain possible changes in global mean temperature (GMT) and then use coupled climate models to map those changes onto finer spatial scales to estimate changes in other variables. Other methods use data mined from `ensembles of opportunity' such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Several challenges with current approaches have been identified. Here, we focus on demonstrating the issues inherent in applying global `top-down' climate scenarios to explore financial risks at geographical scales of relevance to financial institutions (e.g. city-scale). We use data mined from the CMIP to determine the degree to which estimates of GMT can be used to estimate changes in the annual extremes of temperature and rainfall, two compound events (heatwaves and drought, and extreme rain and strong winds), and whether the emission scenario provides insights into the change in the 20, 50 and 100 year return values for temperature and rainfall. We show that GMT provides little insight on how acute risks likely material to the financial sector (`material extremes') will change at a city-scale.

  abstract = {Efforts to assess risks to the financial system associated with climate change are growing. These commonly combine the use of integrated assessment models to obtain possible changes in global mean temperature (GMT) and then use coupled climate models to map those changes onto finer spatial scales to estimate changes in other variables. Other methods use data mined from `ensembles of opportunity' such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Several challenges with current approaches have been identified. Here, we focus on demonstrating the issues inherent in applying global `top-down' climate scenarios to explore financial risks at geographical scales of relevance to financial institutions (e.g. city-scale). We use data mined from the CMIP to determine the degree to which estimates of GMT can be used to estimate changes in the annual extremes of temperature and rainfall, two compound events (heatwaves and drought, and extreme rain and strong winds), and whether the emission scenario provides insights into the change in the 20, 50 and 100 year return values for temperature and rainfall. We show that GMT provides little insight on how acute risks likely material to the financial sector (`material extremes') will change at a city-scale. We conclude that `top-down' approaches are likely to be flawed when applied at a granular scale, and that there are risks in employing the approaches used by, for example, the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System. Most fundamental, uncertainty associated with projections of future climate extremes must be propagated through to estimating risk.

Consequently, water uses ecological implications within the industry are not well understood, albeit public perceptions suggesting that the industry is a water guzzler and polluter. This manuscript proposes water footprint inventory data for the industry to enable researchers to conduct water footprint studies. The median total water loss intensities for surface mines with and without beneficiation are 331 and 276 L/ton, whereas those of underground mines with and without beneficiation are 420 and 262 L/ton, respectively. The water-intensive sinks are evaporation, dust suppression, and discharge into the environment. Water management practices, i.e., the high recycling rate in mines with excess water, non-segregation of clean and dirty water streams, and deficient water treatment infrastructure, are the root causes of the water pollution in collieries. Although low pH, high sulfates, and high total dissolved solids in coal effluents are congruent to other jurisdictions, the high cyanide, iron, manganese, and mercury content make the country's pollutants inventory data uniquely different. Misalignment between drinking water and effluent discharge limits are the causes of regulatory challenges. The voluntary disclosure practice prohibits transparency within the industry.},

Amidst concerns of greenwashing, reliable sustainability assessment methods are needed to ensure that funds are channeled towards priority sectors for the transition to a low-carbon and more inclusive economy. This critical review provides a classification, analysis and evaluation of current sustainability measurement methods for investment funds from both industry and academia. The evaluation is based on a seven-criteria matrix, developed based on gaps identified in seminal academic works and in reports from international organizations. Following the evaluation, we find that carbon footprints and exposure metrics and environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings, while widely used, have several shortcomings, failing to capture the real-world sustainability impact of investments. We suggest that open-source, science-based and sustainability-driven assessment methods are prioritized going forward. Methods can be upgraded by incorporating measurement of positive impact creation and by adopting a life cycle perspective. Given the need to anchor sustainability assessments in the reality, the compatibility of investment products with science-based targets for sustainable development should become a central element of reporting requirements. Finally, methods incorporating a forward-looking perspective, as well as an assessment of investor's additionality are scarce and should be given priority in future research.},

Building on best practices from the industrial ecology field, we develop an input-output life cycle assessment (IOLCA) methodology to estimate life cycle GHG emissions of companies and investment funds. We apply our method to a sample of 1340 sustainable (SRI) and conventional equity funds domiciled in Europe and their 11,275 unique holdings. We extend our application to a case study of funds self-classified as Article 8 and Article 9 funds under the recent European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR, 2019). Our model estimates life cycle emissions for 94\% of the companies held -- compared to 17\% coverage in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). When including scope 3, the exposure to GHG emissions of both SRI and conventional funds is two to three times larger than when considering only direct impacts from holdings' operations. Finally, 24\% of the sampled Europe-domiciled SRI funds are more exposed to life cycle carbon emissions than the ETF tracking the conventional market index MSCI Europe.},

Yet, scientific understanding of anthropogenic freshwater change and its long-term evolution is limited. Using a multi-model ensemble of global hydrological models, we estimate how, over a 145-year industrial period, streamflow and soil moisture have deviated from pre-industrial baseline conditions (defined by 5th--95th percentiles, at 0.5{$^\circ$} grid level and monthly time step). We find increased frequency of local deviations on {\textasciitilde}45\% of land area, mainly in regions under heavy direct or indirect human pressures. To estimate humanity's aggregate impact on the freshwater cycle, we present the evolution of deviation occurrence at regional to global scales. Currently, local streamflow and soil moisture deviations occur on 18.2\% and 15.8\% of global land area, respectively, which is 8.0 and 4.7 percentage points beyond the {\textasciitilde}3 percentage point wide pre-industrial variability envelope. Finally, we discuss applying our approach to define a planetary boundary for freshwater change. Our results indicate a substantial shift from stable pre-industrial streamflow and soil moisture conditions to persistently increasing change and a transgression of the freshwater change planetary boundary, calling for urgent actions to reduce human disturbance of the freshwater cycle.}

We offer a brief overview of the conceptual integration of CAS research and its implications for the advancement of SES studies and methods. We propose a conceptual typology of six organizing principles of CAS based on a comparison of leading scholars' classifications of CAS features and properties. This typology clusters together similar underlying organizing principles of the features and attributes of CAS, and serves as a heuristic framework for identifying methods and approaches that account for the key features of SES. These principles can help identify appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three main implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and studying SES interactions. Third, engagement with SES as CAS poses normative challenges for problemoriented researchers and practitioners taking on real-world challenges.},

Here we demonstrate the links between data sources, EBVs and indicators and discuss how different sources of biodiversity observations can be harnessed to inform EBVs. We classify sources of primary observations into four types: extensive and intensive monitoring schemes, ecological field studies and satellite remote sensing. We characterize their geographic, taxonomic and temporal coverage. Ecological field studies and intensive monitoring schemes inform a wide range of EBVs, but the former tend to deliver short-term data, while the geographic coverage of the latter is limited. In contrast, extensive monitoring schemes mostly inform the population abundance EBV, but deliver long-term data across an extensive network of sites. Satellite remote sensing is particularly suited to providing information on ecosystem function and structure EBVs. Biases behind data sources may affect the representativeness of global biodiversity datasets. To improve them, researchers must assess data sources and then develop strategies to compensate for identified gaps. We draw on the population abundance dataset informing the Living Planet Index (LPI) to illustrate the effects of data sources on EBV representativeness. We find that long-term monitoring schemes informing the LPI are still scarce outside of Europe and North America and that ecological field studies play a key role in covering that gap. Achieving representative EBV datasets will depend both on the ability to integrate available data, through data harmonization and modeling efforts, and on the establishment of new monitoring programs to address critical data gaps.},

Additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental European and Anglo-Saxon fund managers.},

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment was carried out via ReCiPe H method to evaluate environmental impact of the hydrometallurgical zinc production chain in China. National statistical data and process-based life cycle inventory (LCI) were used to build a zinc production LCI at the macro level. To confirm the credibility of this study, an uncertainty analysis was conducted via Monte-Carlo simulation. The impacts of climate change, human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, metal depletion, and fossil depletion categories on the overall environmental burden were examined. The overall environmental burden was dominated by key processes, such as zinc ore mining and energy (i.e., electricity and natural gas) consumption. In 2013, the amounts of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, zinc, and copper generated by hydrometallurgical zinc production were 2.60~{\texttimes}~107, 4.29~{\texttimes}~104, 6.77~{\texttimes}~104, 1.23~{\texttimes}~104, 1.38~{\texttimes}~103, and 3.20~{\texttimes}~102~t. The first four substances accounted for 0.25\%, 0.21\%, 0.30\%, and 0.10\% of the overall national emission. Effective approaches to reduce the overall environmental impact of hydrometallurgical zinc production include improving the efficiencies of electricity, natural gas, and zinc ore consumption; substituting clean energy for coal-based electricity production; reducing the direct emission of zinc and copper; and increasing the national zinc recycle rate.},

We explore the idea that natural capital has an insurance value insofar as it can mitigate the effects of uncertainty on human well-being. We present a formal model that substantiates this claim. We propose a definition for the insurance value of natural capital for a stochastic and dynamic ecosystem that provides ecosystem services for a risk-averse user. The insurance value of natural capital depends on the properties of ecosystem dynamics as well as on the risk and time preferences of the ecosystem user. It can be positive or negative. We relate the natural insurance value to conservative use of the ecosystem and precautionary investment in the natural capital stock. For the case of logarithmic per-period utility we find that optimal management becomes more conservative with increasing uncertainty if and only if the insurance value of natural capital is positive. We qualify this finding for more general forms of the per-period utility function.},

We adopt an inter\- pretive approach, using Q methodology to explore framings of SBTs amongst 22 scientists and practitioners engaged in SBT development. Results show two distinct framings: `we need science-based targets to help eco\- nomic systems move towards global sustainability' and `the system itself is unsustainable and needs to change --science-based targets can help', with areas of agreement and disagreement. They lean towards reformist or radical discourse, at times weaving them together. What kinds of `transformation', if any, are SBTs capable of driving? Conceptualising SBTs as a boundary object, we suggest that sustainability transformations involve paradoxical tensions, including where actors appeal to the powerful to drive change, but this inhibits the most radical discourses. We conclude with potential implications for sustainability science and governance.},

This extension of the theory is necessary because of the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, on one hand, and the expansion of the category of funds considered to be Universal Owners on the other-through the rise of fiduciary capitalism and the increase in institutional ownership, and through the increasing prevalence of passive investing. This paper incorporates several novel elements into Universal Ownership Theory: an Existential Risk lens, which highlights the portfolio risk of civilisational collapse; a theoretical framework that reflects advances in behavioural science; a practical investment framework based on the tenets of Positive Investment, including asset class-specific recommendations with a focus on capital allocation, the primary-to-secondary market transition, and "ungameable" metrics; and the proposition of a "duty of expansion" for Universal Owners to extend participation to communities and regions of the world currently underrepresented among the body of large institutional investors.},

Through an exploration of the relevant evidence and theory, this paper lays out some of the systemic risks the Covid-19 pandemic and its continuing aftermath have revealed; quantifies the opportunity for long-term asset owners -- universal owners -- to counter these risks at the company level; identifies shifting norms; and examines the ways in which norms in the financial system emerge, take hold, and even become self-fulfilling. Having done so, the paper then tests universal ownership theory against two established norm formation frameworks while proposing the addition of a ``momentum/velocity'' condition to the existing norm formation theories. Following Marti \& Gond's pathway towards self-fulfilling theories, it ends by puts forward four experiments for asset owners to test whether universal ownership theory could become self-fulfilling, including an experiment that recommends implementation of an Advance Notice of Future Litigation that allows litigation for future harms to be priced into the market in the present. Our findings suggest that universal ownership has the potential to become a self-reinforcing norm in the financial sector, and therefore that universal owners may be capable of helping to mitigate the emerging polycrisis.},

This paper evaluates the available substantiation for investor impact claims across asset classes, including through stewardship activities and social discourse, and identifies gaps in research on private climate finance. From this analysis emerges a framework for the characteristics of a product that would combine the highest-impact levers -- from sector focus and exclusion methodologies to asset class and investor engagement efficacy -- to maximise the probability of institutional investor impact on real-world emissions. The paper concludes with a call for further research and the creation of a fossil fuel phase-out bond index with a variety of stewardship characteristics designed to maximise investor impact on company-level behaviour change, cost of capital for fossil fuel expansion and, ultimately, real-economy emissions.},

One of the driving forces is the growing significance of data as an asset, as `oil of the 21st century'. Trade secrets are often seen as the major Intellectual Property (IP) tool for protecting data. There is also the understanding that the need to share data is increasing to allow for new types of innovation. This paper seeks to understand how data sharing practices and the use of trade secrets are evolving in the agricultural industries. Using explorative empirical data from four in-depth case studies, the paper develops a framework for data sharing practices, value sharing, and trade secrets use. We find that current data sharing practices pool around two scenarios, where data is not shared or shared only with limited partners (hence closed) and there are differences whether value created from the data is shared. We conclude that a nuanced view on the use of trade secrets in data sharing is mandated for both IP/data managers and scholars analysing the topic.},

In this paper, we verify whether ESG mutual funds actually invest in firms that have stakeholder-friendly track records.

Relative to other funds offered by the same asset managers in the same years, ESG funds hold stocks that are more likely to voluntarily disclose carbon emissions performance but also stocks with higher carbon emissions per unit of revenue. Despite these findings, ESG funds hold portfolio firms with higher average ESG scores. We show that ESG scores are correlated with the quantity of voluntary ESG-related disclosures but not with firms' compliance records or actual levels of carbon emissions. Finally, ESG funds appear to underperform financially relative to other funds within the same asset manager and year, and to charge higher fees. Our findings suggest that socially responsible funds do not appear to follow through on proclamations of concerns for stakeholders.},

  abstract = {South Africa's extensive mineral resources have resulted in mining activities dispersed across the country, playing a critical role in its socio-economic development. In contrast to this abundance of mineral wealth, water resources are generally limited, and vulnerable to environmental impacts from the mining industry. These circumstances make tailored management of water resources in the mining sector essential. To achieve this, detailed information on water use throughout a mine operation as well as an accurate water balance account is required. Blue-water footprints have the potential to contribute to this task as they allow for quantification of direct and indirect water use across the supply chain of a process, while incorporating both spatial extension and temporal duration. As defined by the Water Footprint Network's (WFN) globally acknowledged water footprint assessment methodology, a blue-water footprint is determined by calculating the net consumptive use of water by an operation. According to the WFN, this includes water which is evaporated, incorporated into a product, or lost to outflows which do not return to the same catchment area in the same period.The applicability of this tool in the mining sector has not been fully explored. Therefore, it was decided to investigate the bluewater footprint of a South African platinum mining operation. The results showed that the largest consumption of water in the production of platinum was due to evaporation from the mineral processing plants (36.8\%) and the tailings storage facilities (19.4\%). To improve its water-use efficiency, measures should be taken by the operation to mitigate evaporative losses. Floating covers can assist in this effort as they reflect a proportion of the incoming solar radiation and act as a physical barrier to the passage of water vapour, both vertically and horizontally.},

  abstract = {Climate change has become a main concern of ministries of finance, central banks, and financial regulators. In response, a suite of scenarios and tools have been developed to assess the financial risks from physical climate shocks (for example, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, flooding). However, those scenarios do not fully capture such shocks, which could lead financial institutions to underestimate the potential scale of climate risks and underprice investments in resilience. This is particularly important for emerging markets and developing economies where exposure to physical climate risks is already high and is expected to further increase with climate change. The paper identifies five areas, or risk drivers, that make a material contribution to physical climate risks to the financial sector and that are not consistently included in current scenarios and tools: (1) extreme weather events, (2) uncertainties in climate models, (3) compound scenarios, (4) indirect economic impacts of shocks, and (5) feedback between the real economy and the financial sector. We derive a framework for generating scenarios to assess acute physical climate-related financial risks, which is inspired by the ``Realistic Disaster Scenarios'' that are used in risk management and supervision in the insurance sector. The framework is illustrated through an application of the EIRIN macroeconomic model. This framework aims to complement recent work by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to inform ministries of finance, central banks, financial regulators, and financial institutions on climate financial risk assessments, both for micro- and macroprudential risk management, and to incorporate climate risks into wider financial decision making and disclosures.},

Many people do not save enough for retirement, which may be due to uncertainty about the future or saving plans. Making social comparisons can reduce uncertainty and upward comparisons can provide the motivation to improve. For this reason, the authors gave participants social feedback on their savings decisions. Participants who were randomly told that they underperformed in comparison with their peers were more likely to make changes to their allocation. In Study 1, this group increased their savings more than were those who had been categorized among the better performers or overperformers, or who did not receive social information. Participants were generally more likely to change their behavior when they perceived their performance as being average or below average. The results demonstrate that a social comparison approach has the potential to motivate people to start saving for retirement or increase their current savings.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a self-administered questionnaire and adopted the convenience sampling technique followed by a snowball sampling method for the survey to collect data from the individual investors covering the four distinct states of India. Collected data were analysed on AMOS 20.0 using two-step structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: Results indicated a significant effect of all the predictive variables. Past behaviour showed no significant direct impact on investor's intention; however, it had an indirect significant relationship while mediated by the attitude of investors. The multiple squared correlation (R2) showed that the final model could explain 36\% of the variance in investors' intention towards stock investment which signified a successful implementation of the TPB model along with external variables added to it. Moreover, Indian investors were found to be highly influenced, primarily, by social pressure which could be curbed through financial literacy. Practical implications: A significant importance of subjective norms was found on stock market participation which could be a strategic theme for the government and the policymakers to educate investors through their opinion leaders for increasing their participation. Moreover, by doing so investors could control their behaviour and take rational decisions. Originality/value: This study extended the understandings of investor's decision-making behaviour using TPB by incorporating the two external variables viz., Financial literacy and past behaviour. The addition of past behaviour is perhaps the novelty of this article since such examination has not been conducted empirically especially in the case of developing countries like India.},

We find that the magnitude of the difference in equity valuation with respect to a world without climate damages mainly depends i) on the aggressiveness of the abatement policy (the slower the abatement, the greater the difference); ii) on the presence of otherwise of tipping points with relatively low threshold temperatures; and iii) on the extent to which rates will decline in states of low consumption (of economic distress). The difference in equity valuations between a no-climate-damage world and a world with climate damages can be significant, ranging from a few percentage points to over 40{\textbackslash}\% depending on the abatement policy, the nearness of tipping point, and the magnitude of the discounting effect. This leaves open the question of the extent to which these differences in valuation are already embedded in equity market prices. We argue that current valuations appear to imply either a very strong and effective abatement action, or that climate change will have a negligible effect on economic output. Since neither assumption should be considered a very likely scenario, we conclude that there is ample potential for equity revaluation.},

Storm losses continue to grow and much of them are uninsured. These losses represent an increasing burden to individuals, businesses, and can jeopardize national development goals. Pre-hazard mitigation is cost effective, but both the public and private sector struggle to finance up-front investments in it. This article explores a resilience solution that combines risk transfer (e.g., insurance) with risk reduction (e.g., hazard mitigation), which have often been treated as two separate mechanisms for disaster risk management. The combined mechanism could help align environmental and risk management goals and create opportunities for public and private investment in nature-based projects. We assessed this resilience insurance with hypothetical cases for coral reef restoration. Under conservative assumptions, 44\% of the initial reef restoration costs would be covered just by insurance premium reductions in the first 5 years, with benefits amounting {$>$}6 times the total costs over 25 years. We also test the sensitivity to key factors such as project cost, risk reduction potential, insurance structure, economic exposure and discount rates. The resilience insurance mechanism is applicable to many coastlines and can help finance nature-based adaptation.},

However, renewable energy facilities can be land-use intensive and impact conservation areas, and little attention has been given to whether the aggregated effect of energy transitions poses a substantial threat to global biodiversity. Here, we assess the extent of current and likely future renewable energy infrastructure associated with onshore wind, hydropower and solar photovoltaic generation, within three important conservation areas: protected areas (PAs), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and Earth's remaining wilderness. We identified 2,206 fully operational renewable energy facilities within the boundaries of these conservation areas, with another 922 facilities under development. Combined, these facilities span and are degrading 886 PAs, 749 KBAs and 40 distinct wilderness areas. Two trends are particularly concerning. First, while the majority of historical overlap occurs in Western Europe, the renewable electricity facilities under development increasingly overlap with conservation areas in Southeast Asia, a globally important region for biodiversity. Second, this next wave of renewable energy infrastructure represents a {\textasciitilde}30\% increase in the number of PAs and KBAs impacted and could increase the number of compromised wilderness areas by {\textasciitilde}60\%. If the world continues to rapidly transition towards renewable energy these areas will face increasing pressure to allow infrastructure expansion. Coordinated planning of renewable energy expansion and biodiversity conservation is essential to avoid conflicts that compromise their respective objectives.},

  abstract = {Cocoa production has been identified as a major global driver of deforestation, but its precise contribution to deforestation dynamics in West Africa remains unclear. It is also unknown to what degree companies and international markets are able to trace their cocoa imports, and satisfy their sustainable sourcing commitments. Here, we use publicly-available remote-sensing and supply chain data for C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, the world's largest cocoa producer, to quantify cocoa-driven deforestation and trace 2019 cocoa exports and the associated deforestation from their department of origin, via trading companies, to international markets. We find 2.4 Mha of cocoa deforestation and degradation over 2000--2019, i.e. 125 000 ha y -1 , representing 45\% of the total deforestation and forest degradation over that period. Only 43.6\% (95\% CI: 42.6\%--44.7\%) of exports can be traced back to a specific cooperative and department. The majority of cocoa (over 55\%) thus remains untraced, either indirectly sourced from local intermediaries by major traders (23.9\%, 95\% CI: 22.9\%--24.9\%), or exported by untransparent traders---who disclose no information about their suppliers (32.4\%). Traceability to farm lags further behind, and is insufficient to meet the EU due-diligence legislation's proposed requirement for geolocation of product origins. We estimate that trading companies in the Cocoa and Forests Initiative have mapped 40\% of the total farms supplying them, representing only 22\% of all Ivorian cocoa exports in 2019. We identify 838 000 hectares of deforestation over 2000--2015 associated with 2019 EU imports, 56\% of this arising through untraced sourcing. We discuss issues of company- and state-led traceability systems, often presented as solutions to deforestation, and stress the need for transparency and for the sector to work beyond individual supply chains, at landscape-level, calling for collaboration, stronger regulatory policies, and investments to preserve the remaining stretches of forests in West Africa.},

  abstract = {Eating ``less but better'' meat can be a strategy to guide meat consumption in Western or high-income countries towards sustainability, but what~``better'' means~depends on the perspective. Multiple studies and reports suggest that agroecological farming systems could contribute to a broad range of sustainability benefits, but few studies have examined the implications for people and nature following trade-offs between sustainability priorities at the farm level. Therefore, this study explored the effects on a broad range of sustainability themes following agroecological transition on a case farm in east-central Sweden. We applied a novel mixed-methods approach, combining the indicator-based SMART-Farm tool with additional quantitative and qualitative analysis of the farm's climate impact, contribution to global food security, economic performance, and working conditions. The results showed improvements for aspects within environmental, social, economic, and governance-related sustainability dimensions, with corroborating results across methods. The case farm thus served as an example of transition to a more sustainable production system, but as expected, there were both trade-offs and synergies between sustainability aspects. Negative effects were found for economic aspects at the farm and societal level. For this case, one may conclude that ``better'' meat production both supports and depends on, a more sustainable farm; but that ``better'' meat and a more sustainable farm cannot be viewed in isolation from the wider food system. Also, ``better'' can be described by several states along a transition pathway. Key contributions of the study are threefold, a) articulation of the links between agroecology and the concept ``less but better,'' b) empirically demonstrating synergies and trade-offs in striving for more sustainable meat production, and c) a novel methodological approach for sustainability assessment.},

The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400--1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2{$^\circ$}C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

Recent empirical attempts to reinvestigate this number have lacked raw data on how much food smallholders produce, and have relied on model assumptions with unknown biases and with limited spatial and commodity coverage. We examine variations in crop production by farm size using a newly-compiled global sample of subnational level microdata and agricultural censuses covering more countries (n=55) and crop types (n=154) than assessed to date. We estimate that farms under 2ha globally produce 28--31\% of total crop production and 30--34\% of food supply on 24\% of gross agricultural area. Farms under 2ha devote a greater proportion of their production to food, and account for greater crop diversity, while farms over 1000ha have the greatest proportion of post-harvest loss.},

  abstract = {The widely reported claim that smallholders produce 70--80\% of the world's food has been a linchpin of agricultural development policy despite limited empirical evidence. Recent empirical attempts to reinvestigate this number have lacked raw data on how much food smallholders produce, and have relied on model assumptions with unknown biases and with limited spatial and commodity coverage. We examine variations in crop production by farm size using a newly-compiled global sample of subnational level microdata and agricultural censuses covering more countries (n=55) and crop types (n=154) than assessed to date. We estimate that farms under 2ha globally produce 28--31\% of total crop production and 30--34\% of food supply on 24\% of gross agricultural area. Farms under 2ha devote a greater proportion of their production to food, and account for greater crop diversity, while farms over 1000ha have the greatest proportion of post-harvest loss.},

  abstract = {Can SRI be a means to make investors both virtuous and prosperous? This paper argues that there can be significant tensions between these goals, and that SRI (and indeed all investment) should not allow the pursuit of maximizing investment returns to prevail over an ethical agenda of promoting social and economic justice and environmental protection. The discourse on SRI has changed dramatically in recent years to the point where its capacity to promote social emancipation, sustainable development and other ethical goals is in jeopardy. Historically, SRI was a boutique sector of the market dominated by religious-based investors who sought to invest in accordance with the tenets of their faith. From the early 1970s, the aspirations of the SRI movement morphed significantly in the context of the divestment campaign against South Africas apartheid regime. No longer were social investors satisfied with just avoiding profit from immoral activities; instead, they also sought to change the behavior of others. Business case SRI is a problematic SRI benchmark for several reasons: often there is a countervailing business case for financing irresponsible activities, given the failure of markets to capture all social and environmental externalities; secondly, even if investors care about such concerns, there may be no means of financially quantifying their significance for investment purposes; and, thirdly, even if such factors can be financially quantified, they may be deemed to be such long-term financial costs or benefits that they become discounted and ignored. The ethics case for SRI and ethical business practices more generally takes the view that both investors and the companies they fund have ethical responsibilities that trump the pursuit of profit maximization. Ethical investment should be grounded on this foundation. However, it may not be enough. To keep ethical investment ethical will likely require institutionalizing new norms and governance standards, in such domains as reforming fiduciary duties and the internal governance of financial organizations. SRIs own codes of conduct including the UNPRI have yet to demonstrate the robustness to move the financial community beyond business as usual. {\copyright} Springer 2010.},

Here we estimate country-level contributions to the SCC using recent climate model projections, empirical climate-driven economic damage estimations and socio-economic projections. Central specifications show high global SCC values (median, US\$417 per tonne of CO2 (tCO2); 66\% confidence intervals, US\$177--805 per tCO2) and a country-level SCC that is unequally distributed. However, the relative ranking of countries is robust to different specifications: countries that incur large fractions of the global cost consistently include India, China, Saudi Arabia and the United States.},

Extreme winds and precipitation CEs occur more frequently in many regions, particularly under higher emissions. Heatwaves and drought occur more frequently everywhere under all emission scenarios examined. For each CMIP6 model, we derive a skill score for simulating CEs. Models with higher skill in simulating historical CEs project smaller increases in the number of heatwaves and drought in Eurasia, but larger numbers of strong winds and heavy precipitation CEs everywhere for all emission scenarios. This result is partly masked if the whole CMIP6 ensemble is used, pointing to the considerable value in further improvements in climate models.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The soaring demand for cobalt for lithium-ion batteries has increased interest in the utilization of non-conventional cobalt sources. Such raw materials include complex ores containing minerals such as cobaltite and skutterudite, which, while rare, occur around the world, including in Finland, Canada, and the USA. The goal of this study was to evaluate the cradle-to-gate impacts of cobalt sulfate recovery from unutilized cobalt- and gold-bearing ores with the use of process simulation. Methods: A literature analysis was conducted to establish the state-of-the-art processing methods for complex cobalt ores containing significant amounts of gold. The drafted process was simulated using HSC Sim software to obtain a mass and energy balance, which was compiled into a life cycle inventory (LCI). The environmental impact categories (global warming, acidification, eutrophication, ozone depletion, photochemical smog creation, water use) were calculated in GaBi software. Uncertainty regarding the possible future raw material composition was studied, and the simulation was used to investigate process performance and to evaluate the effect of variation in the process parameters on the environmental impact indicators. Results and discussion: The results indicated that the main cobalt mineral type (cobaltite, linnaeite) had only minor effects on the evaluated impact categories. With cobaltite-dominated ores (High As case), the global warming potential (GWP) was estimated to be 20.9~kg CO2-eq, of which 12.7~kg CO2-eq was attributed to the hydrometallurgical process. With linnaeite-dominated ores, the equivalent values were 20.4~kg CO2-eq and 11.0~kg CO2-eq. The production of a high grade concentrate was observed to greatly decrease the impacts of the hydrometallurgical process, but the cobalt losses in the beneficiation stage and the mineral processing impacts would likely increase. The simulation showed that there is still potential to improve the cobalt recovery (to approximately 96\%), which would also affect the indicator values. Conclusions: The impacts were estimated prior to intensive metallurgical testing to determine the possible high impact areas in the process. Based on this, it is suggested that, during hydrometallurgical processing, improved treatment of cobalt-containing wash waters and the optimization of oxygen utilization efficiency in pressure leaching are the most significant ways to decrease the environmental impacts. Optimal solutions for the concentrate could be found when experimental data on the minerals processing steps becomes available.},

An investment portfolio's shadow impacts represent the economic, social and environmental effects underlying an investor's decision to place their funds in particular financial instruments. In this study, we focus on greenhouse gas emissions to show which sectors of the United States economy have particularly large or small carbon shadows and place those results in the context of volatility and earnings. To demonstrate how SIC may be used, we examine the endowment investments of a Canadian university in the context of divesting from fossil fuel companies. Our analysis suggests that large pooled funds choosing to direct their investments away from heavy carbon emitters may have less of an impact than would otherwise be expected. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

At the same time, neo-liberal reforms have caused a diffusion of power across sectors and borders, confounding efforts to promote governmental openness. Economic liberalization has also made it more difficult to enforce corporate disclosure requirements. Meanwhile, technological change has spurred efforts by businesses and citizens to strengthen their control over corporate and personal information. Efforts to defend the borders of the `informational commons' -- the domain of publicly accessible information -- will also be complicated by problems of policy design and political mobilization. Imposing transparency requirements was easier when national and sub-national governments closely held authority. The task is more difficult when power is widely diffused.},

The issue of IAM transparency has been an ongoing concern for approximately two decades regarding the cloaking of value-laden assumptions and output uncertainties. Due to the opaque nature of IAMs, the credibility of modeling results and the associated policy recommendations are patently limited, with policymakers inevitably having reservations as to the robustness of modeling outcomes given the deficit of information regarding the underlying assumptions. In an attempt to address the issue of a lack of transparency concerning IAM usage by the IPCC, a database containing the climate mitigation scenario ensemble which underpinned the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C was made publicly available, the IAMC 1.5{$^\circ$}C Scenario Explorer database. Despite this database, the omission of critical model input data and accompanying supporting documentation from its content fails to fulfill its raison d'{\^e}tre, that is to say, to ensure reproducibility and transparency. If the issue of IAM transparency is not fully addressed in the upcoming AR6 with respect to the provision of IAM input data, accompanied by supporting documentation, then the IPCC will have failed to meet its own declared commitment for this assessment cycle.

Although ``safe'' and ``just'' Earth system targets are interrelated, we see safe as primarily referring to a stable Earth system and just targets as being associated with meeting human needs and reducing exposure to risks. To align safe and just dimensions, we propose to address the equity dimensions of each safe target for Earth system regulating systems and processes. The more stringent of the safe or just target ranges then defines the corridor.

  abstract = {The stability and resilience of the Earth system and human well-being are inseparably linked 1--3 , yet their interdependencies are generally under-recognized; consequently, they are often treated independently 4,5 . Here, we use modelling and literature assessment to quantify safe and just Earth system boundaries (ESBs) for climate, the biosphere, water and nutrient cycles, and aerosols at global and subglobal scales. We propose ESBs for maintaining the resilience and stability of the Earth system (safe ESBs) and minimizing exposure to significant harm to humans from Earth system change (a necessary but not sufficient condition for justice) 4 . The stricter of the safe or just boundaries sets the integrated safe and just ESB. Our findings show that justice considerations constrain the integrated ESBs more than safety considerations for climate and atmospheric aerosol loading. Seven of eight globally quantified safe and just ESBs and at least two regional safe and just ESBs in over half of global land area are already exceeded. We propose that our assessment provides a quantitative foundation for safeguarding the global commons for all people now and into the future.},

We capture two channels of financial contagion. The first channel concerns direct interconnectedness, via a network of interbank loans, banks' loans to other corporate and retail clients, and securities holdings. The second channel concerns indirect interconnectedness, via overlapping exposures to common asset classes. To assess the impact of contagion, we apply the structural valuation model NEVA, in which common shocks to banks' external assets are reflected in a consistent way in the market value of banks' mutual liabilities through the network of obligations. Applying the model to a unique supervisory data set collected by the European Central Bank that covers 26 large banks in the euro area we identify a strongly non-linear relationship between diversification of exposures, shock size, and losses due to interbank contagion. We also demonstrate the potential for contagion effects to amplify first-round stress test results due to interconnectedness. Finally, we provide insights into the potential impact of more diversified versus more domestic portfolio allocation strategies on the propagation of contagion, which are relevant to policy discussions about international risk sharing, for instance, in the context of the EU Capital Market Union.},

Although decision-makers are seeking to implement policies regarding CCS, the consequences of this technology on water scarcity have not been fully assessed. Here we simulate the impacts on water resources that would result from retrofitting global CFPPs with four different CCS technologies. We find that 43\% of the global CFPP capacity experiences water scarcity for at least one month per year and 32\% experiences scarcity for five or more months per year. Although retrofitting CFPPs with CCS would not greatly exacerbate water scarcity, we show that certain geographies lack sufficient water resources to meet the additional water demands of CCS technologies. For CFPPs located in these water-scarce areas, the trade-offs between the climate change mitigation benefits and the increased pressure on water resources of CCS should be weighed. We conclude that CCS should be preferentially deployed at those facilities least impacted by water scarcity. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) but it needs additional power that increases water use for plant cooling. This study models the impacts of retrofitting CFPPs with CCS on water resources globally and finds areas at risk of water scarcity.},

  abstract = {Information about a company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance has become increasingly important in the decision-making process of financial institutions. The financial implications of environmental challenges (e.g. water stress), negative social impacts (e.g. health impacts in local communities) or poor corporate governance (e.g. breaching legislation) all continue to increase. Accordingly, there is a need for financial institutions to incorporate information on ESG risks, opportunities and impacts in decisions that relate to risk management, investments, credit, strategy, and reporting. ESG information is typically disseminated through ESG ratings, which combine the three constituents into a single rating, or ascribe them separate scores. The compilation of ESG ratings and the identification of appropriate data sources is an inherently complex process; as such, there is no single standard for data collection or reporting. This has led to a divergence in the underlying data sources used by different rating providers, as well as in the determination of factors that are deemed worthy of measurement in the first place. For example, when assessing a company's environmental impact, one rating provider may rely on company-provided data, while another may incorporate independent third-party assessments. Unfortunately, there is currently no clear mechanism for effectively resolving such disagreements to establish a standardised approach to ESG rating assessments. However, geospatial data and analyses offer several key advantages for ESG assessments, including consistency, the potential for enhanced accuracy, and the ability to identify and assess environmental impacts at a detailed physical asset level, in addition to evaluating the broader spatial context. By incorporating geospatial information (obtained through manually processing remotely sensed data, or by using existing products) rating methodologies can be improved, and disparities can be addressed more effectively. This would enable a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental considerations of ESG assessments, promoting a more informed and precise decision-making process. Within this context, a few institutions (e.g. the University of Oxford, the WWF, and a few others) are pioneering thought leadership around spatial finance, including the assessment of ESG issues utilising geospatial intelligence, but there are no consistent frameworks for incorporating geospatial data into ESG ratings and analysis. This paper explores the opportunity for such a geospatial environmental scoring framework, defining a variety of methods in which open data with broad geographic coverage could be incorporated into ESG analysis, generalisable to a range of assets and sectors. The proposed framework is organised into two categories: localised effects, which directly impact the immediate vicinity of an asset, and delocalised effects, which contribute to global climate change and atmospheric pollution. Sub-scores are defined within these categories, which capture both the localised effects on land use, biodiversity, soils, and hydrology, and the global impacts resulting from atmospheric emissions. The approaches for handling geospatial data to generate both these sub-scores and the final E-score are presented, including a test case, and the complete methodology is made available in open repositories.},

However, there has been little investigation of how political dynamics systematically influence these models' development and outputs, or the implications for energy strategies, targets and interventions. Using in-depth interviews with 24 European modellers and policyworkers, we illuminate the politics of economic modelling within European Union (EU) energy policymaking, focusing on dynamics of contestation, differentiated influence and power relations within models' a) framing of questions and problems; b) framing of scenarios and solutions; c) structural assumptions and d) definition of quantitative data inputs. We then consider deeper questions of e) access and exclusion, showing how modelling is used to silence critical voices and reinforce incumbent interests. We argue that understanding this politics of modelling is crucial to the implementation of sustainable energy transitions. We conclude with recommendations for researchers and policyworkers seeking to promote the use of alternative/innovative models in energy policy (within and beyond the EU), centring on reflexivity; recognition; and relationship-building. Developing multi-sectoral `communities of practice' around innovative modelling approaches is vital in challenging a vicious circle of evidence and policy that legitimises business-as-usual in a dangerously warming world.},

Yet, we find that an exogenous change in a stock's ESG rating exerts a transitory price pressure and alters the composition of stock ownership. Individual investors are especially sensitive to the 'pseudo'-changes in the ESG ratings. They (dis)invest in stocks that they misconceive as ESG (down-) upgraded. Short sellers act as arbitrageurs and take the other side of retail investors' trades. Overall, we find that a one standard deviation quasi-increase in the ESG ratings translates into 1pp drop in stock monthly abnormal return.},

The chapter shows that CSR is a social norm that would endogenously emerge from the stakeholders' social contract seen as the first move in an equilibrium selection process that reaches the equilibrium state of a CG institution. The social contract provides a model of the impartial mediating reasoning performed by a board of directors striving to balance different claims of stakeholders. It also allows deducing the multistakeholder objective function that socially responsible firms maximize, and then provides a specification of the particular fiduciary duties owed to each stakeholder according to its position. {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons.

We found that applying the mitigation hierarchy as part of a comprehensive biodiversity action plan substantially reduced impacts on biodiversity in all habitats studied. Avoidance and right of way minimization contributed to significant impact reduction. We quantified impact reduction during construction and operation on the right of way of the pipeline over a five-year period and found that restoration was the greatest contributor to reducing impacts. We documented that most ELUs have a positive restoration trajectory. We also documented how monitoring over large scale spatial scales, in combination with site-specific monitoring, generated data for management to determine restoration priorities and impact mitigation. A biodiversity action plan that incorporated the mitigation hierarchy and a science-based biodiversity monitoring and assessment program contributed to biodiversity management of the project and played an important role in minimizing and managing impacts.},

Our findings suggest that the EU's regulatory effort on sustainable finance has not yet delivered on anti-greenwashing objectives, and that ESG based investing is doing little to shift fund allocations.},

It gives some background by way of introducing ontological ideas about what money and finance is. Thereafter, the chapter starts by discussing some of the classic and sweeping criticisms to the effect that all (or at least most) financial activities are morally suspect, for example criticisms of usury and speculation. The following section assumes that the existence of financial markets can be acceptable and discusses some of the ethical issues involved in making them honest and fair, for example the challenges of deception and insider trading. Finally, the chapter discusses ideas to the effect that financial agents have social responsibilities that go beyond their role as market participants, for example an extended responsibility to promote social welfare. The overarching aim of the chapter is to help further establish the new field of ``financial ethics.''},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study focuses on the environmental assessment of European copper production. Life cycle assessment is applied to analyse copper cathode production in Sweden, including its mining (an open-pit mine) and refining (pyrometallurgy), and using two combinations of software and databases: SimaPro software with ecoinvent database and GaBi software with GaBi database. The results are compared with results from other case studies from literature. Methods: A cradle-to-gate LCA was conducted considering 1 tonne of copper as functional unit. The inventory for the foreground system was elaborated using primary data gathered by the staff from the mine, the concentrator and the smelter. For the background data, LCA databases are used considering datasets for the Swedish market whenever possible. As the smelter has multiple useful outputs, economic allocation was applied at the inventory level. The calculation method CML-IA baseline 3.5 was considered for both combinations of software and database, reporting all the impact categories of the method plus the Cumulative Energy Demand. Results and discussion: The inventory of the system and the main environmental hotspots were presented, such as the explosives for blasting (due to their supply chain) or the electricity used in the concentrator. The results obtained with the two combinations of LCA software and databases yield large differences for categories such as abiotic depletion (7.5 times higher for SimaPro and ecoinvent), possibly due to differences in the system boundaries of the databases and the characterisation factors of the method. Although the case study has a relatively high cumulative energy demand (140/168 kMJ/tonne Cu) compared to other mines, its performance in global warming (3.5/4.7 tonne CO2eq/tonne Cu) is much better due to the low greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, which shows that the electricity mix is a key aspect. Conclusions: The environmental performance of mining depends partially on the specific conditions of the deposit, e.g., the ore grade and the mining type. LCA practitioners should consider the potential different results that can be obtained using different combinations of software and database and exert caution when comparing cases, especially for abiotic depletion, human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories. Finally, the use of renewable energies can be key to improve the environmental sustainability of copper production.},

The major market barriers are transactional costs, i.e. additional tracking required for reporting purposes, lack of market liquidity and identification of environmental impact or additionality. Canadian green bonds are also more likely to be evaluated on their green impact than their global market peers.Research limitations/implications Limitations of this study include its focus on Canada, which may exclude or not apply to drivers and barriers in other green bond markets.Practical implications The paper helps create an accounting-based conceptual framework for key motivations and barriers that affect financial decision-making regarding green bonds.Social implications The authors identify economic and policy-related barriers and drivers for green bonds, addressing the financing gap for the LCR economy.Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to identify and compare Canadian green bond market drivers and barriers and to examine relevant stakeholder- and policy-related approaches that can be targeted to scale this market effectively.},

Taking their advantage as insurers, insurance companies should contribute toward the realisation of a low-carbon society and a climate-resilient society through their core business by means of mitigation and adaptation strategies. To achieve this goal, ``education'' is paramount, as it is the foundation of all our endeavours. For a business to grow in a sustainable manner, it is vital that the society itself develops in a sustainable manner.

  abstract = {"Tunnel vision" is a double-edged sword. It can be a positive force, focusing attention and creating momentum to act. Vice President Gore shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the IPCC when he helped focus the world's attention on climate change and the urgent need to bring people and resources to bear on addressing the crisis. Nearly a decade later, we struggle to make Gore's message heard: the enormity and complexity of the climate challenges facing us --- facing our planet, our cultural and political systems, our legal regimes, our moral constructs --- demand attention and action now. However, there exists a tension between the pressing need for action and the importance of making well-considered choices. Tunnel vision is a dangerous lens through which to view potential solutions to climate change. It is a form of selective attention which can lead to inadequate problem-formulation, partial solutions to complex problems, and unintended side effects. Tunnel vision as an approach to the multifaceted problem of climate change limits our strategies for mitigating and adapting to the warming of the planet and, ultimately, fosters additional problems. This paper speaks to the need to identify and consider the co-benefits and co-detriments (the side effects) of the climate change policies and projects we consider, particularly given the magnified impact of climate change and climate change policies on vulnerable populations.},

To explore this mechanism, we study the extent to which investors respond to signals about the environmental or social benefits stemming from given projects or firms. We find evidence of a carbon risk premium: debt from entities with a higher carbon footprint trades at marginally higher yields, all else the same. We also document that investors are willing to pay a social premium-which we refer to as "socium"-when a firm issues a social rather than a conventional bond. The magnitudes of the carbon risk premium and socium are modest but non-negligible in some industrial sectors and market segments. Some obstacles-such as "ESG washing"-stand in the way of further ESG market deepening, limiting contributions to sustainable development.},

This model simulates -- internally consistently -- the growth and productivity of both natural and agricultural vegetation as coherently linked through their water, carbon, and energy fluxes. These features render LPJmL4 suitable for assessing a broad range of feedbacks within and impacts upon the terrestrial biosphere as increasingly shaped by human activities such as climate change and land use change. Here we describe the core model structure, including recently developed modules now unified in LPJmL4. Thereby, we also review LPJmL model developments and evaluations in the field of permafrost, human and ecological water demand, and improved representation of crop types. We summarize and discuss LPJmL model applications dealing with the impacts of historical and future environmental change on the terrestrial biosphere at regional and global scale and provide a comprehensive overview of LPJmL publications since the first model description in 2007. To demonstrate the main features of the LPJmL4 model, we display reference simulation results for key processes such as the current global distribution of natural and managed ecosystems, their productivities, and associated water fluxes. A thorough evaluation of the model is provided in a companion paper. By making the model source code freely available at https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/lpjml/LPJmL, we hope to stimulate the application and further development of LPJmL4 across scientific communities in support of major activities such as the IPCC and SDG process.},

Recently, impact investing, i.e., investing with the aim of contributing to real-world changes, has been receiving increasing attention. While the literature so far has focused on theoretical and conceptual considerations of impact investing, in practice it often remains unclear what the requirements of an actual impact investment are. Nevertheless, some investment products claim to achieve some form of impact. We investigate if this impact-claim is justified. We analyze 185 (so-called) impact funds based on an established classification scheme that outlines the requirements for factual impact investments. We find that only one-third of the impact funds meet the outlined impact requirements. The share is equally low for funds classified under Article 9 of the E.U.'s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). When looking at the different asset classes, our results show that the share of funds that meet the requirements for impact-generating investments is higher for private equity and private debt than for public equity and bonds.},

Recently, impact investing, i.e., investing with the aim of contributing to real-world changes, has been receiving increasing attention. While the literature so far has focused on theoretical and conceptual considerations of impact investing, in practice it often remains unclear what the requirements of an actual impact investment are. Nevertheless, some investment products claim to achieve some form of impact. We investigate if this impact-claim is justified. We analyze 185 (so-called) impact funds based on an established classification scheme that outlines the requirements for factual impact investments. We find that only one-third of the impact funds meet the outlined impact requirements. The share is equally low for funds classified under Article 9 of the E.U.'s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). When looking at the different asset classes, our results show that the share of funds that meet the requirements for impact-generating investments is higher for private equity and private debt than for public equity and bonds.},

In his claim, the author explained that financial concepts used by the mainstream are not neutral because they refer to a particular ethical judgement mainly focused on the shareholders' interest. In this comment, I explain that this ethical judgement historically results from the role playing by the Gaussian distribution in finance: while this statistical framework gave the first scientific foundations to finance in the 1960s, its symmetrical configuration implies that negative changes occur with the same probability than positive ones. In this context, all potential intervention (regulation) could only interfere (disturb) this ``ethically fair situation'' within the only perturbing element is the shareholder whose behaviours are likely to influence the market. After having explained that this reasoning is based on an a priori statement about observational facts (in opposition with positivism), I present this situation as an opportunity for current researchers in finance to clarify their implicit assumptions; which would open the door to a diversification of modelling in finance as Lagoarde-Segot promoted it in his IRFA article.},

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement establishes provisions for using international carbon market mechanisms to achieve climate mitigation contributions. Environmental integrity is a key principle for using such mechanisms under the Agreement. This paper systematically identifies and categorizes issues and options to achieve environmental integrity, including how it could be defined, what influences it, and what approaches could mitigate environmental integrity risks. Here, environmental integrity is assumed to be ensured if the engagement in international transfers of carbon market units leads to the same or lower aggregated global emissions. Four factors are identified that influence environmental integrity: the accounting for international transfers; the quality of units generated, i.e. whether the mechanism ensures that the issuance or transfer of units leads to emission reductions in the transferring country; the ambition and scope of the mitigation target of the transferring country; and incentives or disincentives for future mitigation action, such as possible disincentives for transferring countries to define future mitigation targets less ambitiously or more narrowly in order to sell more units. It is recommended that policy-makers combine several approaches to address the significant risks to environmental integrity. Key policy insights Robust accounting is a key prerequisite for ensuring environmental integrity. The diversity of nationally determined contributions is an important challenge, in particular for avoiding double counting and for ensuring that the accounting for international transfers is representative for the mitigation efforts by Parties over time.Unit quality can, in theory, be ensured through appropriate design of carbon market mechanisms; in practice, existing mechanisms face considerable challenges in ensuring unit quality. Unit quality could be promoted through guidance under Paris Agreement Article 6, and reporting and review under Article 13.The ambition and scope of mitigation targets is key for the incentive for transferring countries to ensure unit quality because countries with ambitious and economy-wide targets would have to compensate for any transfer of units that lack quality. Encouraging countries to adopt ambitious and economy-wide NDC targets would therefore facilitate achieving environmental integrity.Restricting transfers in instances of high environmental integrity risk -- through eligibility criteria or limits -- could complement these approaches.

Although the design and construction of TSFs is technically challenging,the paper concludes that the basic causes of TSF failure are political, not technical. A second purpose of this paper is to suggest that a social scientific analysis of engineered projects needs to pay attention to the engineering.},

To this aim, Solvency II item-by-item investment data is employed. As part of the Green Deal, the Commission presented the European Green Deal Investment Plan, which will mobilize at least {\texteuro}1 trillion of sustainable investments over the next decade. Our results suggest that currently only a small portion of the insurer's investments are made in economic activities which might be eligible to the EU sustainable finance taxonomy as the insurer's exposures are mainly concentrating toward financial activities. On one hand, this can be interpreted as an indicator of limited exposure to transition risk for the insurance sector but on the other hand also indicates that insurers have the possibility to contribute more significantly to transitioning to a lower carbon society in the future. As major long-term investors, insurers could play a key role in the transition towards more sustainable society. In this respect, the taxonomy can help insurers by providing clarity in identifying sustainable economic activities and avoiding reputational risks.},

Application of the BII is demonstrated on a large region (4 {\texttimes} 106 km2) of southern Africa. The BII score in the year 2000 is about 84\%: in other words, averaged across all plant and vertebrate species in the region, populations have declined to 84\% of their presumed pre-modern levels. The taxonomic group with the greatest loss is mammals, at 71\% of pre-modern levels, and the ecosystem type with the greatest loss is grassland, with 74\% of its former populations remaining. During the 1990s, a population decline of 0.8\% is estimated to have occurred.},

We find that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between financial development and sustainable development but there are various -- often indirect -- linkages. It appears that most of the literature concentrates on the role of public shareholders when it comes to changing corporate policy and performance in a more sustainable direction. However, this focus neglects the potential impact of the credit channel and private equity on a firm's non-financial policies and performance. These very powerful mechanisms can govern business policies and practices. Therefore, there appears to be much more scope for finance to promote socially and environmentally desirable activities and to discourage detrimental activities than has been acknowledged in the academic literature so far.},

It is not uncommon today to come across quantitative metrics assessing the vulnerability of populations, ecosystems, or investments. The concern within is what exactly such figures represent. The following elucidates frequently overlooked temporal aspects of vulnerability and responsibility among populations that practice the perpetual growth of wealth. To investigate this concern, this article offers an examination of three contemporary conceptions of vulnerability: ecological, humanitarian, and fiscal. A brief overview of the origins of the relationship between quantification and capital is offered, along with a history of modern conceptions of vulnerability. Specifically, I am concerned with how the optics of capital displace vulnerability into a perpetually hypothetical future. In analyzing the case studies of ecosystem resilience, climate refugees, and commercial insurance, my aim is to show that dominant methods of measuring vulnerability derive from and reinforce a historically situated neoliberal method of knowledge production, resulting in a paralysis of responsibility.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the fragility of international, national, regional, and local risk management systems. It revealed an urgent need to improve risk planning, preparedness, and communication strategies. In parallel, it created an opportunity to drastically re-think and transform societal processes and policies to prevent future shocks originating not only from health, but also combined with those related to climate change and biodiversity loss. In this perspective, we examine how to improve integrated risk assessment and management (IRAM) capacities to address interconnected shocks. We present the results from a series of workshops within the framework of the University of Zurich and University of Geneva. Initiative "Shaping Resilient Societies: A Multi-Stakeholder Approach to Create a Responsive Society". This initiative gathered experts from multiple disciplines to discuss their perspectives on resilience; here we present the key messages of the "Pandemics, Climate and Sustainability'' thinking group. We identify a roadmap and selected research areas concerning the improvement of IRAM analysis capacities, practices, policies. We recommend the development of robust data systems and science-policy advice systems to address combined shocks emerging from health, biodiversity loss and climate change. We posit that further developing the IRAM framework to include these recommendations will improve societal preparedness and response capacity and will provide more empirical evidence supporting decision-making and the selection of strategies and measures for integrated risk reduction.},

While the concept of sustainability is often associated with a governance design that promotes stakeholder value, the PSI do not appear to be a call for stakeholder-focused insurers. Rather, the PSI appear to be about internalizing tacit claims in the operations of insurers. Conceptual and empirical literature on shareholder value maximization suggests that when an insurer honors its tacit claims the value to shareholders increases. A key insight from practice is that a sincere pursuit of the PSI will expand the scope of corporate risk management.},

  abstract = {Nature-\-based solutions (NbS)---\-solutions to societal challenges that involve working with nature---\-have recently gained popularity as an integrated approach that can address climate change and biodiversity loss, while supporting sustainable development. Although well-\-designed NbS can deliver multiple benefits for people and nature, much of the recent limelight has been on tree planting for carbon sequestration. There are serious concerns that this is distracting from the need to rapidly phase out use of fossil fuels and protect existing intact ecosystems. There are also concerns that the expansion of forestry framed as a climate change mitigation solution is coming at the cost of carbon rich and biodiverse native ecosystems and local resource rights. Here, we discuss the promise and pitfalls of the NbS framing and its current political traction, and we present recommendations on how to get the message right. We urge policymakers, practitioners and researchers to consider the synergies and trade-\-offs associated with NbS and to follow four guiding principles to enable NbS to provide sustainable benefits to society: (1) NbS are not a substitute for the rapid phase out of fossil fuels; (2) NbS involve a wide range of ecosystems on land and in the sea, not just forests; (3) NbS are implemented with the full engagement and consent of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a way that respects their cultural and ecological rights; and (4) NbS should be explicitly designed to provide measurable benefits for biodiversity. Only by following these guidelines will we design robust and resilient NbS that address the urgent challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, sustaining nature and people together, now and into the future.},

  abstract = {Several important issues need to be addressed to make avoided deforestation (AD) a feasible option for climate change policy. Traditional questions associated with land-based sequestration options have largely been discussed in terms of project-based approaches to carbon sequestration. For country-level commitments these concepts remain important, but we argue in this paper that they can and should be addressed differently. In order to address AD, it is useful to begin by outlining the international climate control regimes under which AD could be included as an option. Two general alternatives are discussed: an arrangement that is a linear extension of the current Kyoto Protocol but that involves more countries with specific emission reduction targets, and an alternative expanded arrangement that requires that essentially all countries have greenhouse gas emission targets. We consider how AD would fit into these two general types of international agreements and address questions related to baselines, additionality, permanence, and leakage. We conclude that the key issues related to including deforestation in either of these arrangements revolve around measuring, monitoring (e.g., additionality), and the development of efficient incentives by countries to alter their land-use regimes.},

These climate changes are predicted to continue and possibly accelerate for many decades to come (IPCC 2012). One of the industries most affected by climate change is the insurance industry; for instance, changing weather patterns could lead to increases in damages from events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods (Mufson 2007). Fortunately, however, the insurance industry is uniquely positioned to lead the way with regard to climate change mitigation and risk management. Insurers can promote a more sustainable future through better risk-based modeling and product pricing; through innovative green products; through partnering with businesses for better environmental governance; through alliances with policy-makers and regulators to ensure voluntary market adjustments for risk; and by championing the enforcement of building code efforts (Lloyd's 2006; Liedtke, Schanz, and Stahel 2009). Finally, while insurers can potentially have a major influence over the management of climate change risk in society, they must first model sustainability in order to be credible advisors to customers and other constituents.},

  abstract = {Globally, food systems face multifaceted sustainability challenges and the need for food system transformation is increasingly acknowledged. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the pathways for transformation and how they will play out in diverse regional social-ecological contexts. We explored transformation towards more sustainable and resilient food systems in a specific regional context -- the Stockholm city-region in Sweden. The approach we used is based on a new methodology for bottom-up, participatory narrative scenarios that has been developed in the international sustainability science project ``Bright Spots: Seeds of the Good Anthropocene''. Through a workshop and a survey with a diverse set of regional actors, we developed a vision of a positive food future and identified conflicts and opportunities for moving towards it. The vision highlights four components from across different sectors and represents a significant change from the current situation. The direction of change aligns with global goals of sustainable and healthy diets and promotes increased diversity in crops and landscapes that could strengthen the resilience of regional food systems. However, potential trade-offs between local diversity and global resource efficiency need to be better understood. While the approach revealed barriers in existing economic and socio-cultural mechanisms of global food systems, it also allowed us to identify several opportunities for local initiatives to expand the regional niche, for example by using the leverage of actors situated between producers and consumers. The Seeds of Good Anthropocene scenario methodology helped to understand more of the cross-scale dynamics in a transformation process in a specific social-ecological context and can be useful to navigate food system change in other places as well.},

We develop a methodology to derive comparable and scalable monetized environmental impact estimates by applying characterization pathways and monetization factors to organization level environmental outputs, including carbon emissions, water use, and other emission types. The median environmental impact as a percentage of an organization's sales (operating income), referred to as environmental intensity, is 2\% (22\%) suggesting a significant level of `hidden liabilities' and potential for value erosion if environmental impacts are priced. About 60\% of the variation in environmental intensity is driven by industry membership, while the rest can be attributed to firm specific factors or to country and more granular industry classifications. Environmental intensity exhibits moderate correlation with various environmental ratings across firms and industries and no correlation across firms within industries. Firms with higher environmental intensity exhibit lower corporate market valuation, consistent with investors viewing environmental impacts as financially material and pricing them in some but not all industries. We document the dynamic materiality of environmental intensity, where the relation between environmental intensity and corporation valuation has become stronger in recent years.},

Since IAMs produce least-cost pathways, technoeconomic parameters constitute one of the basic parameters. Traditionally, IAMs dealt with technologies with slowly-changing, relatively homogeneous manner. Since technologies are rapidly evolving, and the pattern of technological development is regionally heterogeneous, the IAM community must embrace a new strategy to treat their underlying technoeconomic parameters. Here we illustrate such challenges by reviewing the treatment and performance of IAMs with respect to some of the rapidly changing technologies (e.g., solar, wind, and batteries). Our review shows that IAMs have difficulty in updating the cost of the rapidly changing technologies. We then articulate a new strategy, drawing upon the lesson from the current model intercomparison projects and climate sciences. We argue that a loose network of modeling groups across the globe should create a database of technological parameters in a standardized format and standard evaluation tool, perhaps to be facilitated by the IAM Consortium. Such a framework would contribute to the review of the progress toward the Paris Agreement goals.},

  abstract = {As organizations strive to meet stakeholders' needs for sustainability information, they convey their status as sustainability leaders by publishing reports and seeking sustainability awards. Our research examines whether the extent of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system implementation, which enables data and process integration across multiple functional areas, increases organizations' ability to capture and integrate information for sustainability reporting. We propose that ERP systems implementation increases organizations' ability to capture sustainability data and provides more and more favorable disclosures, resulting in better sustainability assessment scores by rating agencies and indices such as MSCI and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We also pose research questions about the type of ERP modules that are implemented and how those impact the scores related to the social, environmental, and governance dimensions of sustainability leadership. Our study is expected to contribute to the sustainability reporting and reputation, and the ERP systems literature, and to practice.}

However, a holistic framework for assessing such complex climate change risks has not yet been achieved. Clarity is needed regarding the interactions that generate risk, including the role of adaptation and mitigation responses. In this perspective, we present a framework for three categories of increasingly complex climate change risk that focus on interactions among the multiple drivers of risk, as well as among multiple risks. A significant innovation is recognizing that risks can arise both from potential impacts due to climate change and from responses to climate change. This approach encourages thinking that traverses sectoral and regional boundaries and links physical and socio-economic drivers of risk. Advancing climate change risk assessment in these ways is essential for more informed decision making that reduces negative climate change impacts.},

  abstract = {Integrated assessment models (IAMs) connect trends in future socioeconomic and technological development with impacts on the environment, such as global climate change. They occupy a critical position at the global science-policy interface. IAMs and associated scenarios have come under intense scrutiny, with critiques addressing both methodological and substantive issues, such as land use, carbon dioxide removal and technology performance. Criticisms have also addressed the transparency of IAM methods and assumptions as well as the transparency of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment of IAMs. This paper, authored by the co-chairs of IPCC Working Group III and members of the Technical Support Unit, documents activities aiming to enhance the transparency of IAMs and their assessment. It includes a history of IPCC's approach to scenarios covering the formation of the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) in 2007 and the emergence of the approach by which IPCC facilitates the development of scenarios, but does not produce them itself. An IPCC Expert Meeting at the start of the current assessment cycle made transparency recommendations targeted at both the research community and IPCC. The community has taken steps to ``open the black box'' by moving toward open-source and web-publishing IAM documentation. IPCC has included an Annex to its next report focusing on scenarios and modeling methodologies. An open call for scenario data linked to the current IPCC report includes an expanded set of input and output variables. This paper ends with suggested criteria for measuring the success of these efforts to improve transparency.

Although a framework of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) is emerging for monitoring biodiversity, its poor alignment with remote sensing products hinders interpolation between field observations. This study compiles a comprehensive, prioritized list of remote sensing biodiversity products that can further improve the monitoring of geospatial biodiversity patterns, enhancing the EBV framework and its applicability. The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function EBV classes, which capture the biological effects of disturbance as well as habitat structure, are shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature for direct monitoring of biodiversity from satellites. Biodiversity products that require satellite remote sensing of a finer resolution that is still under development are given lower priority (for example, for the EBV class species traits). Some EBVs are not directly measurable by remote sensing from space, specifically the EBV class genetic composition. Linking remote sensing products to EBVs will accelerate product generation, improving reporting on the state of biodiversity from local to global scales.},

  abstract = {Businesses are embedded within nature. Their supply chains, operations, and products fundamentally depend on and impact nature. These impacts and dependencies can give rise to nature-related risks (as well as related opportunities). However, despite growing expectations from stakeholders, most businesses are currently not adequately measuring and reporting on these. To date, it has not been clear whether this requires the development of entirely new indicators, or whether various existing sustainability reporting frameworks could provide sufficient information on nature-related risks. This paper evaluates the decision-usefulness of existing indicators for the softwood plantation forestry industry in Australia. Decision-usefulness is assessed against three criteria: (1) relevance and completeness; (2) faithful representation; and (3) comparability. The results show some potential for adaptation of indicators already used in sustainability-related corporate accounting and reporting, which could help reduce the reporting burden and encourage uptake. However, gaps remain in measuring the financial consequences for business from nature-related risks and in providing sufficient comparable information to evaluate performance across industries and locations. Implications are discussed in relation to recent recommendations from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) sustainability standards IFRS S1 and S2.},

Inspired by what some have called a polycrisis, we explore whether the human trajectory of increasing complexity and influence on the Earth system could become a form of trap for humanity. Based on an adaptation of the evolutionary traps concept to a global human context, we present results from a participatory mapping. We identify 14 traps and categorize them as either global, technology or structural traps. An assessment reveals that 12 traps (86\%) could be in an advanced phase of trapping with high risk of hard-to-reverse lock-ins and growing risks of negative impacts on human well-being. Ten traps (71\%) currently see growing trends in their indicators. Revealing the systemic nature of the polycrisis, we assess that Anthropocene traps often interact reinforcingly (45\% of pairwise interactions), and rarely in a dampening fashion (3\%). We end by discussing capacities that will be important for navigating these systemic challenges in pursuit of global sustainability. Doing so, we introduce evolvability as a unifying concept for such research between the sustainability and evolutionary sciences.

For more information see: This report updates CDP's research and League Table for diversified miners, first published in November 2015. It ranks 12 of the largest publicly listed diversified miners (by market capitalization) on business readiness for a low-carbon economy transition. The companies in aggregate represent 66\% of the global seaborne market in iron ore, 53\% in copper, 42\% in metallurgical coal and 28\% in thermal coal. Mining companies represent the start of the value chain for several sectors set to undergo significant change as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy including utilities, industrials and transport. This economy-wide transition represents opportunities through demand created for materials needed to drive carbon abatement; however, it also poses risks associated with shifts away from some incumbent commodity use.

  abstract = {Purpose: To support the data requirements of stakeholders, the Nickel Institute (NI) conducted a global life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to show, with indicators, the potential environmental impacts of the production of nickel and ferronickel from mine to refinery gate. A metal industry wide agreed approach on by-products and allocation was applied. Methods: Nine companies, comprising 19 operations, contributed data, representing 52 \% of global nickel metal production and 40 \% of global ferronickel production. All relevant pyro- and hydrometallurgical production routes were considered, across most major nickel-producing regions. Data from Russia, the biggest nickel-producing nation, was included; the Chinese industry did not participate. 2011 was chosen as reference year for data collection. The LCIA applied allocation of impacts of by-products using both economic and mass allocations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to further understand the relevance and impact of the different allocation approaches. Results and discussion: The primary extraction and refining steps are the main contributors to primary energy demand (PED) and global warming potential (GWP), contributing 60 and 70 \% to the PED for the production of 1 kg class I nickel and 1 kg nickel in ferronickel, respectively, and over 55 \% of the GWP for both nickel products. The PED for 1 kg class 1 nickel was calculated to be 147 MJ, whilst the PED for 1 kg nickel in ferronickel was calculated to be three times higher at 485 MJ. The main factors influencing energy demand in the metallurgical processes are ore grade and ore mineralogy. Sulphidic ore is less energy intensive to process than oxidic ore. Eighty-six percent of the production volume from class 1 nickel producers, in this study, is from sulphidic ore. All ferronickel was produced from oxidic ore. The LCIA results, including a sensitivity analysis of the impact of producers with higher and lower PED, reflect the influence of the production route on energy demand and on environmental impact categories. Conclusions: Conformant to relevant ISO standards, and backed-up with a technical and critical review, this LCIA quantifies the environmental impacts associated with the production of the main nickel products. With this study, a sound background dataset for downstream users of nickel has been provided. The Nickel Institute aims to update their data in the coming years to reflect upon changes in technology, energy efficiency, and raw material input.},

This shift demands a corresponding shift in education in order to equip students with the skills, theories, and methods they need to address contemporary challenges. We argue that case studies are a productive pedagogical approach to teaching about sustainability and teaching for sustainability. Case-based approaches equip students to encounter complexity, manage uncertainty, and generate innovative strategies. In laying out of the pedagogical challenges inherent in sustainability education, we highlight opportunities and demands for environmental communication scholars to contribute to the emerging discipline of sustainability science.},

We also mention some of the differences in the approaches taken and seek to justify these different approaches by developing the argument that by approaching the same problem from different points of view, new results might emerge. In particular, we review two newly discovered scaling results that appear to be universal, in the sense that they hold for widely different economies as well as for different time periods: (i) the fluctuation of price changes of any stock market is characterized by a probability density function, which is a simple power law with exponent -4 extending over 102 SDs (a factor of 108 on the y axis); this result is analogous to the Gutenberg--Richter power law describing the histogram of earthquakes of a given strength; and (ii) for a wide range of economic organizations, the histogram shows how size of organization is inversely correlated to fluctuations in size with an exponent {$\approx$}0.2. Neither of these two new empirical laws has a firm theoretical foundation. We also discuss results that are reminiscent of phase transitions in spin systems, where the divergent behavior of the response function at the critical point (zero magnetic field) leads to large fluctuations.},

The International Geosphere-B iosphere Programme soon followed, leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment and disciplinary integration. ESS has produced new concepts and frameworks central to the global-c hange discourse, including the Anthropocene, tipping elements and planetary boundaries. Moving forward, the grand challenge for ESS is to achieve a deep integration of biophysical processes and human dynamics to build a truly unified understanding of the Earth System.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are under multiple stressors, and impacts can be measured with multiple variables. Humans have altered mass and energy flows of basically all ecosystems on Earth towards dangerous levels. However, integrating the data and synthesizing conclusions is becoming more and more complicated. Here we present an automated and easy-to-apply R package to assess terrestrial biosphere integrity that combines two complementary metrics.  (i) The BioCol metric that quantifies the human colonization pressure exerted on the biosphere through alteration and extraction (appropriation) of net primary productivity. (ii) The EcoRisk metric that quantifies biogeochemical and vegetation structural changes as a proxy for the risk of ecosystem destabilization.  Applied to simulations with the dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL5 for 1500--2016, we find that large regions presently (period 2007--2016) show modification and extraction of \&gt;20 \% of the preindustrial potential net primary production. The modification (degradation) of net primary production (NPP) as a result of land use change and extraction in terms of biomass removal (e.g., from harvest) leads to drastic alterations in key ecosystem properties, which suggests a high risk of ecosystem destabilization. As a consequence of these dynamics, EcoRisk shows particularly high values in regions with intense land use and deforestation and in regions prone to impacts of climate change, such as the Arctic and boreal zone.  The metrics presented here enable spatially explicit global-scale evaluation of historical and future states of the biosphere and are designed for use by the wider scientific community, being applicable not only to assessing biosphere integrity but also to benchmarking model performance.  The package will be maintained on GitHub and through that we encourage its future application to other models and data sets.},

In order to accelerate the role of financial advisors as change agents for SRI, this study proposes several strategic communication interventions that advisors could employ in their advisory talks to raise more attention and engagement among private investors for SRI. The interventions proposed are oriented on the 5A model of SRI decision making by Herwig Pilaj and drawn from an interdisciplinary literature review on sustainability, communication, and attitudinal and behavioral change. The results provide a perspective and practical guide for financial advisors on how to effectively communicate SRI to private investors. Limitations and areas future research are discussed.},

Based on the Chinese refined lead smelting process, a process-based life cycle assessment model was established to assess the environmental load of lead production system which includes the processes of mining, beneficiation, smelting, electrorefining and transportation. The result shows that the cumulative consumption of electricity and the cumulative emission of green house gases for the production of 1t of refined lead are 1111.93kWh and 2.06E+03kg CO2 eq, respectively. Smelting process is the largest contributor to the environmental impact load, accounting for 51.16\% of the total environmental impact. The environmental category of human toxicity potential(HTP), accounting for 35.26\% of the total environmental impact, is the largest contributor between different environmental categories to the total environmental impact, followed by metal depletion potential(MDP) and fossil depletion potential(FDP), accounting for 27.94\% and 11.80\% of the total environmental impact, respectively. Improving the resource efficiencies of the processes of smelting and beneficiation, and using cleaner energy to generate electricity are the key approaches to reduce the overall environmental impact of lead production in China.},

We demonstrate how local supply reductions in the insurance or other financial services sectors can have a global spillover effect on GDP. We also find that the systemic importance of the financial services and insurance sectors varies over time depending on the size and structure of the economy in different economies (such as the U.S. and China). Additionally, we investigate the impact of simultaneous supply shocks that have originated in the insurance and other financial services (e.g., banking) sectors of different economies. Empirical evidence suggests that simultaneous supply shocks in the financial services sectors in certain economies could contribute to, at least a large portion of, economic downturns, as observed during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.},

Current ESG ratings have limited validity because they are based on idiosyncratic scores derived using subjective, discretionary methodologies. We discuss a new direction for developing corporate environmental performance (CEP) ratings and propose a solution to the limited validity problem by anchoring such ratings in environmental controversies. The study uses a novel machine learning approach to make the ratings more comprehensive and transparent, based on a set of algorithmic approaches that handle nonlinearity when aggregating ESG indicators. This approach minimizes the rater subjectivity and preferences inherent in traditional ESG indicators. The findings indicate that controversies as proxies for non-compliance with environmental responsibilities can be predicted well. We conclude that environmental performance ratings developed using our machine learning framework offer predictive validity consistent with institutional investors' demand for socially responsible investment screening.},

We first build on previous studies and propose an analytical framework to understand BRFR, emphasizing the complexity involved and the limited substitutability of natural capital. We then provide quantitative estimates of dependencies and impacts of the French financial system on biodiversity. We find that 42\% of the value of securities held by French financial institutions comes from issuers that are highly or very highly dependent on one or more ecosystem services. We also find that the accumulated terrestrial biodiversity footprint of these securities is comparable to the loss of at least 130,000 km{$^2$} of ``pristine'' nature, which corresponds to the complete artificialization of 24\% of the area of metropolitan France. Finally, we suggest avenues for future research through which these estimates could feed into future assessments of physical and transition risks.},

A typical lead-zinc mine was taken as the on-site data source, midpoint results with uncertainty information were calculated by ReCiPe H method. After the normalization of midpoint results, marine ecotoxicity was identified as the most predominant environmental impact category, followed by freshwater ecotoxicity, metal depletion, human toxicity and freshwater eutrophication. Contribution analysis indicated that the processing plant can bring the more serious environmental pollution than underground mine and support systems. Tailings dam and chemicals production should be closely watched, owing to the largest pollution contribution. Besides, key processes/substances which can seriously pollute the environment, were classified in this study. Specifically, tailings pollution, copper sulfate production and electricity generation were classified as key processes; metal ions and phosphate discharged into water as key substances. According to sensitivity analysis, reducing tailings pollution should be prioritized for addressing environmental issues. Finally, technical and management measures were proposed to progress the metal industry.},

To evaluate the impact of coal production on the environment, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on the mining process of a typical coal mine in China by using the SimaPro 9.0.0 software. The Ecoinvent v3 database was used to provide the background data, and midpoint results with uncertainty information were calculated using the ReCiPe Midpoint (H) method. After normalising the midpoint results, fossil depletion was identified as the most predominant environmental impact category, followed by marine ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, climate change, freshwater eutrophication, and human toxicity. The contribution analysis indicates that coal mining activities, consumption of steel and electricity, and mine ventilation are the key processes causing the above-mentioned environmental impact categories, which should be paid special attention. According to the sensitivity analysis, the primary countermeasures for addressing the environmental issues are to reduce the mining activities and improve the efficiency of coal mining and utilisation. In addition, the quantitative and comparative analyses show that the gas extraction production mode is beneficial to the environment. Finally, technical measures were proposed to promote green and sustainable development of the coal industry. This research can provide guidance for ensuring national energy security and promoting healthy development of the national economy.},

In order to assess the optimal response of the carbon market to forest sequestration, we couple two global models. An energy--economy--climate model for the study of climate policies is linked with a detailed forestry model through an iterative procedure to provide the optimal abatement strategy. Results show that forestry is a determinant abatement option and could lead to significantly lower policy costs if included. Linking forestry management to the carbon market has the potential to alleviate the policy burden of 50ppmv or equivalently of 14{$\circ$}C, and to significantly decrease the price of carbon. Biological sequestration will mostly come from avoided deforestation in tropical-forest-rich countries. The inclusion of this mitigation option is demonstrated to crowd out some of the traditional abatement in the energy sector and to lessen induced technological change in clean technologies.},

This framework is applied to a content analysis of 178 (183) firm responses to the 2012 (2015) U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners Climate Risk Disclosure Survey to detect evidence of rescaling through climate change risk management (CCRM). The results reveal that the majority of companies do not integrate climate change into their risk management practices, but reinsurers are rescaling in a greater proportion than primary insurers. This finding confirms that a nested spatial and temporal scale in the insurance industry creates resistance to CCRM. The use of scale contributes to emerging scholarship on organizations and climate change by offering a framework for measuring organizational responses and justifying a research agenda on rescaling strategies as a means of risk management.},

Carbon intensity has the largest explanatory power for EPI rankings and consistently produces the correct, anticipated, negative sign in its relationship to EPI. Second in importance are the renewable energy sources, which also produce consistent results with respect to their impact on the EPI but with much lower explanatory power. Our results suggest that advanced countries should, as they are doing already, implement measures of high quality environmental content while measures for increasing economic growth, while controlling emissions, are appropriate for developing countries.

However, the associated concepts and terms are contested---education for sustainable development and education for sustainability represent increasing levels of change required in curricula, while achieving sustainable education will require even greater change. A transformative pedagogy underlies and contributes to the extent of the change, as more argue for a range of analytical and context-related skills to be developed in students. To operationalize education associated with sustainability, teaching approaches must focus on elements relating to the processes of learning, rather than the accumulation of knowledge---to develop graduates with capabilities to improvise, adapt, innovate, and be creative. Skills such as interdisciplinary thinking, problem solving, team working, and holistic thinking are often mentioned. These skills are encompassed by the pedagogy of problem-based learning (PBL), which provides students with opportunities to learn to think, specifically ``how to think'' rather than ``what to think,'' and potentially within the framework of sustainability. Consequently, it is important to identify the commonalities of transformative learning, sustainable education and PBL. A key link here is critical thinking, and the challenge is to transform our pedagogy across all disciplines to have academics and students thinking critically. This article elaborates on these points and argues that the development of thinking is the critical element in education related to sustainability.},

To contribute towards conservation goals, these programs employ a strategy termed the `theory of change, which predicts that as market demand for certified products grows, additional fisheries will improve practices and management in order to gain certification; however, there is limited evidence that this actually occurs, particularly in fisheries that require significant improvements to meet certification requirements. Here, we examine the capacity of one of the largest seafood certification programs in the world, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), to foster transformative change in The Bahamas Caribbean spiny lobster fishery. Drawing on fishery documentation and interviews with fishery stakeholders, we assess the role of the sustainable seafood market throughout the fishery's transformation from ``unsustainable' to an MSC-certified fishery. We found that the MSC played three key roles in transforming the fishery from an undesirable state towards long-term sustainability by creating a stimulus for change, serving as guide prior to and throughout the fishery's transition, and helping to stabilize the fishery in its new trajectory. This study provides the first empirical evidence for the conservation strategy employed by seafood certification programs for improving fisheries that require transformative change in order to meet sustainability goals.},

  abstract = {The significant increase in metal mining and the inevitability of the continuation of this trend suggests that environmental pressures, as well as related impacts, have become an issue of global relevance. Yet the scale of the impact remains, to a large extent, unknown. This paper examines the mining sector's demands on CO2 emissions, water use, as well as demands on land use focusing on four principal metals: iron, aluminium (i.e., bauxite ore), copper, and gold. These materials represent a large proportion of all metallic materials mined in terms of crude tonnage and economic value. This paper examines how the main providers of mining data, the United Nations, government sources of some main metal producing and consuming countries, the scientific literature, and company reports report environmental pressures in these three areas. The authors conclude that, in the global context, the pressure brought about by metal mining is relatively low. The data on this subject are still very limited and there are significant gaps in consistency on criteria such as boundary descriptions, input parameter definitions, and allocation method descriptions as well as a lack of commodity and/or site specific reporting of environmental data at a company level.},

  abstract = {of data and methods DECEMBER 2018 This document outlines the supply chain mapping approach used by Trase to connect subnational regions of production to trading countries and countries of import around the world: Spatially Explicit Information on Production to Consumption Systems (SEI-PCS). SEI-PCS is a form of enhanced material flow analysis that was first published by Godar et al. (2015). It has evolved substantially beyond its initial scope and ambition, including through the integration of additional fine-scale data sets on production, taxation, logistics, sanitary inspections and trade data. The SEI-PCS approach provides a methodological framework for mapping subnational supply chains which is adapted to suit different country and commodity contexts. Depending on data availability and methodological improvements, a given country-commodity combination, such as the exports of Brazilian soy, is mapped using different approaches (SEI-PCS versions) on Trase.earth. Prior to publishing any subnational data, a summary of national-level exports is first published on the Trase platform, which includes official export volumes and freight on board (FOB) values of commodity equivalents, allocated to individual trading companies and countries of destination. The mapping of subnational supply chains, using the SEI-PCS methodology, is then developed in two normally successive versions. SEI-PCS version 1 releases rely heavily on modelling approaches, typically using transportation costs and optimization models to allocate export volumes to individual production regions. If sufficient data are available, this can be replaced with SEI-PCS version 2. Version 2 uses a much more data-driven approach to link production regions, commodity logistic hubs and export facilities, providing very robust supply chain maps with high levels of accuracy and multiple weights of evidence from a variety of official sources. Looking ahead to future Trase work, where version 2 can be applied directly then the need for version 1 is obviated, something that can happen in countries where Trase already has experience in mapping the supply chain of other commodities, and/or potentially in places where official and publicly available traceability systems are in place. The first section of this manual describes Trase's unique approach to supply chain mapping. A second section describes the various versions of SEI-PCS, up to the new version (2.3) released in December Supply chain mapping in Trase: Summary of data and methods 2 2018 for Brazilian soy. SEI-PCS 2.3 for Brazilian soy is Trase's flagship data product and is a major improvement in terms of accuracy and comprehensiveness over v 2.2, which was published in September 2017. This version is expected to be stable, with only minor improvements planned (v. 2.3.1)-for example when new data become available that can reduce the volume of unknown flows, or revise the name of trading companies following mergers and acquisitions. The Trase team is constantly working to improve the supply chain mapping approaches that underpin Trase using new data sources and data technologies. We welcome feedback on our work and ideas for further improvement, including contributions by supply chain actors on unpublished data about their own supply chains-please write to us at info@trase.earth.},

We test to what extent equity market investors demand a premium to compensate for such risks and thus might raise firms' cost of equity capital (CoE). Using data for 1,897 firms spanning 50 countries over the years 2008-2016, we find a distinct and robust positive impact of carbon intensity (carbon emissions per unit of output) on CoE: On average, a standard deviation higher (sector-adjusted) carbon intensity is associated with a CoE premium of 6 (9) basis points or 1.7\% (2.6\%). This effect is primarily explained by systematic risk factors: high-emitting assets are significantly more sensitive to economy-wide fluctuations than low-emitting ones. The CoE impact of carbon intensity is more pronounced in high-emitting sectors, EU countries, and firms subject to carbon pricing regulation. Our results suggest that carbon emission reduction might serve as a valuable risk mitigation strategy.},

From a conservation standpoint, certification of tropical agroforestry crops, especially coffee and cocoa, is of particular interest given the potentially high biodiversity value of agroforestry systems and the substantial market penetration of coffee and cocoa certification in recent years. Here, we review experience with coffee and cocoa certification, summarize evidence on conservation impacts, and explore future needs. While there is much evidence that environmental criteria behind certification support biodiversity conservation, it is less clear to what extent certification is the cause of improved conservation outcomes. Additionally, the farm-scale focus of current certification models may limit delivery of biodiversity conservation benefits, as maintenance of biodiversity depends on processes at larger landscape scales. To address this scale mismatch, we suggest that investment and innovation in certification over the next decade prioritize landscape conservation outcomes. This may be achieved by (1) linking existing certification mechanisms with broader landscape and ecosystem service management approaches and/or (2) expanding current certification models to consider the landscape itself as the certified unit.},

Recent costly weather-related catastrophes with consequent negative impacts on the insurance industry has made the insurance industry a potential advocate for slowing what has been identified as a causal factor in climate change: emissions of greenhouse gases. However, rising costs of claims, without a longer-term trend of such catastrophic losses, will make it difficult to present a strong case for taking costly economic action. Using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model, it is shown that increasing levels of climate variability as embedded in the anticipated variability of damage to insured assets will have an immediate economic cost that could serve to bolster the argument for more immediate action. That cost is shown to be economically justified higher insurance premiums.},

We explored the relationship between ERP systems and green IT practices to assess how green IT provides an opportunity for organizations to improve ERP systems in more environmentally responsible initiatives. For that purpose, we empirically analyzed four Romanian economic sectors based on an online survey that contained criteria to explore organizational awareness about developing green ERP systems. The findings indicate that companies are generally focused on the key benefits of ERP systems related to operational aspects and less on the sustainability benefits.

The Strong Environmental Sustainability Index (SESI), which is based on the Environmental Sustainability Gap (ESGAP) framework, is intended to fill this gap. SESI is the result of aggregating 21 indicators across different dimensions. Each of the underlying indicators is related to the functions of natural capital and normalised using science-based targets. SESI uses the geometric mean to aggregate in order to reflect the limited substitutability between the functions of natural capital. The results of the index, which is computed for 28 European countries, show that several functions of natural capital are impaired in Europe. Countries tend to perform worse in indicators related to pollution and ecosystem health, compared to indicators that describe the provision of natural resources, and human health and welfare. Because the results are sensitive to assumptions in the normalisation, weighting and aggregation processes, the relevant choices have been aligned with the theoretical underpinnings of the ESGAP framework. SESI responds to the demands of the `Beyond GDP' community on the need for a single environmental sustainability metric that can complement GDP in its (mis-)use as a headline indicator for development.},

However, shareholder activism with respect to CSR has thus far not received any scholarly attention in the field of strategic communication. This multidisciplinary study examines shareholder activism as a drive for change in CSR behavior. Using a case study approach, the study analyzes a shareholder resolution sponsored by NYC Public Pension Funds that resulted in an engagement process with CONSOL Energy Inc. regarding environmental responsibility. As a result of the engagement process, the company implemented a series of proactive procedural and structural changes. These findings suggest that reactive responses to societal demands of shareholders can elicit more proactive measures in CSR behavior that the target company would not have enacted otherwise. Consequently, the paper argues that an expanded role of investor relations pushes corporations to meet or even exceed societal expectations of a broader set of stakeholders. This change in practice ensures that corporations are committed to conducting socially desired actions in return for legitimacy in society.},

  abstract = {Decarbonizing world economies implies the deployment of ``green technologies'', meaning a renovation of the energy sector towards using renewable sources and zero emission transport technologies. This renovation will require huge amounts of raw materials, some of them with high supply risks. To assess such risks a new methodology is proposed, identifying possible bottlenecks of future demand versus geological availability. This has been applied to the world development of wind power, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal power and passenger electric vehicles for the 2016--2050 time period under a business as usual scenario considering the impact on 31 different raw materials. As a result, 13 elements were identified to have very high or high risk, meaning that these could generate bottlenecks in the future: cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, gallium, indium, lithium, manganese, nickel, silver, tellurium, tin and zinc. Tellurium, which is mostly demanded to manufacture solar photovoltaic cells, presents the highest risk. To overcome these constraints, measures consisting on improving recycling rates from 0.1\% to 4.6\% per year could avoid material shortages or restrictions in green technologies. For instance, lithium recycling rate should increase from 1\% to 4.8\% in 2050. This study aims to serve as a guideline for developing eco-design and recycling strategies.},

The article reconstructs the evolution of IAMs and their changing role in this interface, investigating how and why IAMs have become so prominent. Based on literature analysis, quantitative document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we describe the historic evolution of the interactions between IAMs and policy-making between 1970 and 2015. We identify five historic phases in which IAMs played distinct mediating roles between science and policy, succeeding to adjust their scenario efforts to the continuously changing demands for knowledge from the policy community. In explaining the prominent role of IAMs, we differentiate between background conditions (material and sociological) and more contextual factors, most notably the flexible, hybrid and broad nature of IAMs as well as the pro-active character of the IAM community to enhance their policy relevance. We draw on the notion of institutional work to explain this success. In light of the urgency of responding to the climate crisis, we suggest that the IAM community may expand their scope of anticipated futures and consider engaging a wider range of publics and societal stakeholders beyond the science-policy interface.},

  abstract = {Cobalt is considered a key metal in the energy transition, and demand is expected to increase substantially by 2050. This demand is for an important part because of cobalt use in (electric vehicle) batteries. This study investigated the environmental impacts of the production of cobalt and how these could change in the future. We modeled possible future developments in the cobalt supply chain using four variables: (v1) ore grade, (v2) primary market shares, (v3) secondary market shares, and (v4) energy transition. These variables are driven by two metal-demand scenarios, which we derived from scenarios from the shared socioeconomic pathways, a ``business as usual'' (BAU) and a ``sustainable development'' (SD) scenario. We estimated future environmental impacts of cobalt supply by 2050 under these two scenarios using prospective life cycle assessment. We found that the environmental impacts of cobalt production could likely increase and are strongly dependent on the recycling market share and the overall energy transition. The results showed that under the BAU scenario, climate change impacts per unit of cobalt production could increase by 9\% by 2050 compared to 2010, while they decreased by 28\% under the SD scenario. This comes at a trade-off to other impacts like human toxicity, which could strongly increase in the SD scenario (112\% increase) compared to the BAU scenario (71\% increase). Furthermore, we found that the energy transition could offset most of the increase of climate change impacts induced by a near doubling in cobalt demand in 2050 between the two scenarios.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a method to assess the environmental impacts of metal scenarios. The method is life cycle based, but enables forward looking and upscaling. The method aims at translating metal demand scenarios into technology-specific supply scenarios, necessary to make the translation into environmental impacts. To illustrate the different steps of the methodology, we apply it to the case of seven major metals. Demand scenarios for seven major metals are taken from literature. We translate those into technology-specific supply scenarios, and future time series of environmental impacts are specified including recycling rates, energy system transformation, efficiency improvement, and ore grade decline. We show that the method is applicable and may lead to relevant and, despite many uncertainties, fairly robust results. The projections show that the environmental impacts related to metal production are expected to increase steeply. Iron is responsible for the majority of impacts and emissions are relatively unaffected by changes in the production and energy system. For the other metals, the energy transition may have substantial benefits. By far, the most effective option for all metals appears to be to increase the share of secondary production. This would reduce emissions, but is expected to become effective only in the second half of the twenty-first century. The circular economy agenda for metals is therefore a long-term agenda, similar to climate change: Action must be taken soon while benefits will become apparent only at the long term.},

In this work, the potential solar land requirements and related land use change emissions are computed for the EU, India, Japan and South Korea. A novel method is developed within an integrated assessment model which links socioeconomic, energy, land and climate systems. At 25--80\% penetration in the electricity mix of those regions by 2050, we find that solar energy may occupy 0.5--5\% of total land. The resulting land cover changes, including indirect effects, will likely cause a net release of carbon ranging from 0 to 50 gCO2/kWh, depending on the region, scale of expansion, solar technology efficiency and land management practices in solar parks. Hence, a coordinated planning and regulation of new solar energy infrastructures~should be enforced to avoid a significant increase in their life cycle emissions through terrestrial carbon losses.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to update the average environmental impacts of global primary zinc production using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. This study represents the latest contribution from zinc producers, which historically established the first life cycle inventory for primary zinc production in 1998 (Western Europe) and the first global LCA-based cradle-to-gate study for zinc concentrate and special high-grade zinc (SHG; 99.99~\%) in 2009. Improvements from the previous studies were realized through expanded geographical scope and range of production technologies. Methods: The product system under study (SHG zinc) was characterized by collecting primary data for the relevant production processes, including zinc ore mining and concentration, transportation of the zinc concentrate, and zinc concentrate smelting. This data was modeled in GaBi 6 and complemented with background data from the GaBi 2013 databases to create the cradle-to-gate LCA model. Allocation was used to distribute the inputs and outputs among the various co-products produced during the production process, with mass of metal content being the preferred allocation approach, when applicable. Results and discussion: In total, this global study includes primary data from 24 mines and 18 smelters, which cover 4.7 {\texttimes} 106~MT of zinc concentrate and 3.4 {\texttimes} 106~MT of SHG zinc, representing 36 and 27~\% of global production, respectively. While the LCA model generated a full life cycle inventory, selected impact categories and indicators are reported in this article (global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, ozone creation potential, and primary energy demand). The results show that SHG zinc has a primary energy demand of 37,500~MJ/t and a climate change impact of 2600~kg~CO2-eq./t. Across all impact categories and indicators reported here, around 65~\% of the burden are associated with smelting, 30~\% with mining and concentration, and 5~\% with transportation of the concentrate. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for the allocation method (total mass versus mass of metal content) and transportation of zinc concentrate. Conclusions: This study generated updated LCA information for the global production of SHG zinc, in line with the metal industry's current harmonization efforts. Through the provision of unit process information for zinc concentrate and SHG zinc production, greater transparency is achieved. Technological and temporal representativeness was deemed to be high. Geographical representativeness, however, was found to be moderate to low. Future studies should focus on increasing company participation from underrepresented regions.},

We observed very little change over time in the kinds of fishery and seafood problems reported in the media sampled; themes consistently focused on environmental aspects of fisheries (social wellbeing aspects did not appear in the sample as linked with the term ``sustainability''); and very few media reports on sustainable seafood cited aquaculture as a solution.

  abstract = {There is a need for more integrated research on sustainable development and global environmental change. In this paper, we focus on the planetary boundaries framework to provide a systematic categorization of key research questions in relation to avoiding severe global environmental degradation. The four categories of key questions are those that relate to (1) the underlying processes and selection of key indicators for planetary boundaries, (2) understanding the impacts of environmental pressure and connections between different types of impacts, (3) better understanding of different response strategies to avoid further degradation, and (4) the available instruments to implement such strategies. Clearly, different categories of scientific disciplines and associated model types exist that can accommodate answering these questions. We identify the strength and weaknesses of different research areas in relation to the question categories, focusing specifically on different types of models. We discuss that more interdisciplinary research is need to increase our understanding by better linking human drivers and social and biophysical impacts. This requires better collaboration between relevant disciplines (associated with the model types), either by exchanging information or by fully linking or integrating them. As fully integrated models can become too complex, the appropriate type of model (the racehorse) should be applied for answering the target research question (the race course).},

  abstract = {This paper describes the possible developments in global energy use and production, land use, emissions and climate changes following the SSP1 storyline, a development consistent with the green growth (or sustainable development) paradigm (a more inclusive development respecting environmental boundaries). The results are based on the implementation using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model and are compared with a) other IMAGE implementations of the SSPs (SSP2 and SSP3) and b) the SSP1 implementation of other integrated assessment models. The results show that a combination of resource efficiency, preferences for sustainable production methods and investment in human development could lead to a strong transition towards a more renewable energy supply, less land use and lower anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2100 than in 2010, even in the absence of explicit climate policies. At the same time, climate policy would still be needed to reduce emissions further, in order to reduce the projected increase of global mean temperature from 3{$^\circ$}C (SSP1 reference scenario) to 2 or 1.5{$^\circ$}C (in line with current policy targets). The SSP1 storyline could be a basis for further discussions on how climate policy can be combined with achieving other societal goals.},

The results of our experiment indicate that to stimulate sustainable investment, investors should be exposed to positive environmental pictures and that this effect is stronger for highly proactive individuals. These results suggest that proactive individuals in particular view sustainable investing as a way to promote environmental preservation. Our results hold even after controlling for wealth effects.},

  abstract = {The crop residue burning in India particularly North-western India is responsible for air pollution episodes and public health concerns; greenhouse gases emissions and radiation imbalance; and declining soil organic matter and soil productivity. The objectives of this paper are to estimate the crop residue burning and emissions from crop residue burning, to recommend interventions in crop residue management and to propose a crop residue management-bioeconomy model incorporating strategies to sustainably manage the crop residues through interventions that enable waste valorization, food and nutritional security, farmers' livelihood and sustainable agricultural production system. A national inventory on crop residue burning including the pollutant species was prepared using the IPCC methodology. The crop types included for the estimation are cereals, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, jute and Mesta. The total amount of crop residues generated and burned for the year 2017-18 was estimated at 516 million tonnes and 116 million tonnes respectively. It is estimated that 116.3 Tg of crop residues burning released about 176.1 Tg of CO2, 10 Tg of CO, 313.9 Gg of CH4, 8.14 Gg of N2O, 151.14 Gg of NH3, 813.8 Gg of NMVOC, 453.4 Gg of PM2.5, and 935.9 Gg of PM10. The emission estimates can be a proxy to prepare the national level inventory of air pollutant species from crop residue burning. The crop residue management (CRM) demands a transition from the traditional zone of CRM to bioeconomy zone of CRM, wherein the interventions aim at the sustainability of agroecosystem. The proposed bioeconomy model has a four-pronged strategy that includes smart agriculture practices, waste bioeconomy involving aspirational principles of bioeconomy, capacity building of stakeholders' and proactive government policy. Sustainable agricultural bioeconomy provides ample opportunities to reduce crop residue burning, increase farmers' livelihood and decarbonize the agricultural production. India's efforts and policies can provide lessons for other agricultural regions having similar environmental constraints.},

Existing tools for performing this translation generally require a number of manual steps which introduces error and is inefficient. Demeter makes this process seamless and repeatable by providing gridded and land cover change (LULCC) products derived directly from an IAM---in this case, the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM)---in a variety of formats and resolutions commonly used by ESMs. Demeter is publicly available via GitHub and has an extensible output module allowing for future ESM needs to be easily accommodated.},

Traditionally relying on its engineering expertise to maximize ore extraction, the sector must now find ways to sustain its production while facing increased scrutiny from the public, civil societies and shareholders alike. The paper reviews current practice in sustainability assessment to highlight sector-specific characteristics and the notion of trust as central to effective project developments. Because the social interface of extractive operations is complex, dynamic and non-linear in nature, we recommend going beyond the aim of obtaining a social license to operate and use Systems Thinking to fully embed Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at the core of strategic mine planning. System Dynamics can foster interdisciplinary collaborations by bridging together social and technical flows within simulation models to identify sustainable levers of change. We present the development of a stock and flow model quantifying causal mechanisms between the use of cyanide, the environment, communities and public trust, and operational productivity. Industry practitioners, researchers and facilitators can use the model as an adaptable framework to engage with systems modelling in mining. We recommend its use in conjunction with meaningful stakeholder's engagement to ensure shared understanding, reduced uncertainty and long-term benefits for all.},

Such modelling provides arguments in favour of two classically opposed visions of the future of mineral resources: an unaffordable increase in costs and prices following the depletion of high quality deposits or, on the contrary, a favourable compensation by technological improvements. Both views are true, but not at the same time. After a period of energy and production cost gains, we now appear to be entering a pivotal period of long-term production cost increases as we approach the minimum practical energy and thermodynamic limits for many metals.},

All new model features are described in full detail and the results of a global simulation of the historic past (1901--2009) are presented for evaluation of the model performance. We find that the implementation of nitrogen limitation significantly improves the simulation of global patterns of crop productivity. Regional differences in crop productivity, which had to be calibrated via a scaling of the maximum leaf area index, can now largely be reproduced by the model, except for regions where fertilizer inputs and climate conditions are not the yield-limiting factors. Furthermore, it can be shown that land use has a strong influence on nitrogen losses, increasing leaching by 93\&thinsp;\%.},

  abstract = {This Australian study seeks to better understand the disparity between the positive attitudes towards Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and the level of investment in SRI, by examining both the attitudes to SRI and the investment choices that are made. It is hypothesised that those who are more committed to principles of environmental sustainability are more likely to invest in SRI. To test this, 318 people from two large Queensland organisations are surveyed in relation to their investment attitudes and preferences. We find that there are significant differences in investment attitudes with environmentalists placing more importance on SRI investment criteria. However, there was no significant difference between environmentalists and non-environmentalists in terms of utility scores from an investment selection experiment with the environmentalists placing higher importance on financial performance criteria than SRI criteria, making choices similar to those with the lowest level of environmental activism. Furthermore, the observed lack of congruency between attitudes and choices in relation to environmental criteria may have implications for the growth of SRI funds. {\copyright} 2007 The Authors.},

This paper explores the memes used by progressive socio-economic initiatives to assess whether they are consistently and powerfully deployed, using the aspirational statements of 126 different initiatives, sorted into nine categories. The memes (in this case, words) used by these initiatives demonstrate lack of consistency and lack of potentially resonant memes overall. Aspirational statements from both progressive and conservative think tanks are then compared to see whether their messaging is consistently developed in their aspirational statements. Results indicate that memes associated with the neoliberal narrative are considerably more consistently used by conservative think tanks than is any coherent or consistent messaging by progressive think tanks, a finding that becomes more powerful when two- and three-word meme sets are considered.},

However, green water lacks explicit consideration in the existing planetary boundaries framework that demarcates a global safe operating space for humanity. In this Perspective, we propose a green water planetary boundary and estimate its current status. The green water planetary boundary can be represented by the percentage of ice-free land area on which root-zone soil moisture deviates from Holocene variability for any month of the year. Provisional estimates of departures from Holocene-like conditions, alongside evidence of widespread deterioration in Earth system functioning, indicate that the green water planetary boundary is already transgressed. Moving forward, research needs to address and account for the role of root-zone soil moisture for Earth system resilience in view of ecohydrological, hydroclimatic and sociohydrological interactions.},

To navigate these risks, or potential undesirable outcomes of the future, we need tools and an understanding of how to assess risk in a complex world. Risk assessments are a powerful tool to address sustainability challenges. However, two issues currently hamper their ability to deal with sustainability risks: the limited sustainability science engagement with the multifaceted nature of risk and the lack of integration of social-ecological, complex, and resilience thinking into risk assessment. In this Perspective, we review and synthesize the wide range of risk definitions and uses and juxtapose them with knowledge on complex adaptive social-ecological systems. Through this synthesis, we highlight the strengths of each risk approach and outline five challenges that, if overcome, could turn risk assessments into a much-needed multifaceted toolbox for dealing with the certain uncertainty of a complex future.},

Several sustainability accounting frameworks exist, designed to track corporate environmental impacts through corporate reporting, and there is currently a push toward standardization of these. However, most sustainability accounting frameworks still fail to fully capture the connections between corporate activities and impacts, as they depart from what is important for the companies (materiality assessments) and often rely on relative metrics. Here, we propose 15 essential environmental impact variables (EEIVs), applicable to all sectors, based on absolute metrics and what is essential for staying within the planetary boundaries. We argue that standardization must rather depart from these underlying premises. By designing EEIVs for seven primary industries with large environmental footprints and demonstrating the operationality via the aquaculture sector, we show how EEIVs efficiently identify the most important corporate impact information while increasing transparency between companies and stakeholders, thus enabling external assessment of corporate sustainability.},

Specifically, it is unclear whether long-term energy scenarios assuming the expansion of low carbon energy technology are sustainable in terms of resource constraints. However, there are few studies that comprehensively analyze the possibility of resource constraints in the process of introducing low carbon energy technology from a long-term perspective. Hence, to provide guidelines for technological development and policy-making toward realizing the low carbon society, this paper undertakes the following: (1) Estimation of the impact of the expansion of low carbon energy technology on future metal demand based, on the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s scenarios; (2) estimation of the potential effects of low carbon energy technology recycling on the future supply-demand balance; (3) identification of critical metals that require priority measures. Results indicated that the introduction of solar power and next-generation vehicles may be hindered by resource depletion. Among the metals examined, indium, tellurium, silver, lithium, nickel and platinum were identified as critical metals that require specific measures. As recycling can reduce primary demand by 20\%{\textasciitilde}70\% for low carbon energy technology, countermeasures including recycling need to be considered.},

  abstract = {Global energy transitions could fundamentally change flows of both minerals and energy resources over time. It is, therefore, increasingly important to holistically and dynamically capture the impacts of large-scale energy transitions on resource flows including hidden flows such as mine waste, as well as direct flows. Here we demonstrate a systematic model that can quantify resource flows of both minerals and energy resources under the energy transition by using stock-flow dynamics and the concept of Total Material Requirement (TMR). The proposed model was applied to the International Energy Agency's scenarios up to 2050, targeting 15 electricity generation and 5 transport technologies. Results indicate that the global energy transition could increase TMR flows associated with mineral production by around 200--900\% in the electricity sector and 350--700\% in the transport sector respectively from 2015 to 2050, depending on the scenarios. Such a drastic increase in TMR flows is largely associated with an increased demand for copper, silver, nickel, lithium and cobalt, as well as steel. Our results highlight that the decarbonization of the electricity sector can reduce energy resource flows and support the hypothesis that the expansion of low-carbon technologies could reduce total resource flows expressed as TMR. In the transport sector, on the other hand, the dissemination of Electric Vehicles could cause a sharp increase in TMR flows associated with mineral production, which could offset a decrease in energy resource flows. Findings in this study emphasize that a sustainable transition would be unachievable without designing resource cycles with a nexus approach.},

This condition calls for strategic planning based on the expected long-term demand and supply of these metals and the implications attached. Here, we provide the first systematic review of studies (88 studies in all) exploring the projected long-term status of various critical materials, covering 48 elements with 546 data points for global demand through 2030 and 2050. Interestingly, results indicate that, to date, no long-term demand outlook is available for some high criticality metals. We also find that the social and environmental implications induced by demand growth are largely overlooked in these studies, resulting in less attention being given to the spatial divergence between consuming and producing countries in the global supply chain. Moreover, circular economy strategies that include component reuse and remanufacturing have been barely incorporated into the modelling frameworks presented in these studies, while end-of-life recycling is heavily focused on. In addition, elemental linkages (e.g., indium-zinc-steel) are underemphasized, leading to a lack of understanding of future availability and sustainable cycles. All of these findings affirm the need for further scientific research that explores the long-term status of critical metals, which strongly connects to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations and implementation of the Paris Agreement.},

This paper develops global targets for metal flows, stocks, and use intensity in the global economy out to 2100. These targets are consistent with emissions pathways to achieve a 2 {$^\circ$}C climate goal and cover six major metals (iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, and nickel). Results indicate that despite advances in low-carbon metal production, a transformative system change to meet the society's needs with less metal is required to remain within a 2 {$^\circ$}C pathway. Globally, demand for goods and services over the 21st century needs to be met with approximately 7 t/capita of metal stock---roughly half the current level in high-income countries. This systemic change will require a peak in global metal production by 2030 and deep decoupling of economic growth from both metal flows and stocks. Importantly, the identified science-based targets are theoretically achievable through such measures as efficient design, more intensive use, and longer product lifetime, but immediate action is crucial before middle- and low-income countries complete full-scale urbanization.},

Accordingly, this extensive review ex\- plores the projected long-term status of six major metals---iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, and nickel---with around 200 data points for global demand through 2030, 2050 and 2100. Our findings showed that global demand for these major metals is likely to increase continuously over the 21st century, increasing approximately 2--6-fold depending on the metal. Although the extraction and processing required to meet this increase in demand must be environmentally sustainable, the existing extraction and processing scenarios have few explicit linkages to the Earth's carrying capacity. We further found that strategy choices are heavily biased towards endof-life phase analyses, specifically that of end-of-life recycling. Consequently, a full range of opportunities across entire life cycles is being overlooked, including advances in product design, manufacturing and in-use phases. Importantly, despite the emergence of numerous scenarios, few provide science-based targets for major metal flows, stock, circularity, and efficiency. These knowledge gaps need to be addressed urgently in order to ensure that future research directly supports science-based decision and policy making.},

  abstract = {The global transition to fundamentally decarbonized electricity and transport systems will alter the existing resource flows of both fossil fuels and metals; however, such a transition may have unintended consequences. Here we show that the decarbonization of both the electricity and transport sectors will curtail fossil fuel production while paradoxically increasing resource extraction associated with metal production by more than a factor of 7 by 2050 relative to 2015 levels. Importantly, approximately 32--40\% of this increase in resource extraction is expected to occur in countries with weak, poor, and failing resource governance, indicating that the impending mining boom may result in severe environmental degradation and unequal economic benefits in local communities. A suite of circular economy strategies, including lifetime extension, servitization, and recycling, can mitigate such risks, but they may not fully offset the growth in resource extraction. Our findings underscore the importance of institutional instruments that enhance the resource governance of entire low-carbon technology supply chains, along with circular economy practices. In the absence of such actions, the decarbonization of electricity and transport sectors may pose an ethical conundrum in which global carbon emissions are reduced at the expense of an increase in socio-environmental risks at local mining sites.},

  abstract = {The current decarbonization strategy for the steel and cement industries is inherently dependent on the build-out of infrastructure, including for CO2 transport and storage, renewable electricity, and green hydrogen. However, the deployment of this infrastructure entails considerable uncertainty. Here we explore the global feasible supply of steel and cement within Paris-compliant carbon budgets, explicitly considering uncertainties in the deployment of infrastructure. Our scenario analysis reveals that despite substantial growth in recycling- and hydrogen-based production, the feasible steel supply will only meet 58--65\% (interquartile range) of the expected baseline demand in 2050. Cement supply is even more uncertain due to limited mitigation options, meeting only 22--56\% (interquartile range) of the expected baseline demand in 2050. These findings pose a two-fold challenge for decarbonizing the steel and cement industries: on the one hand, governments need to expand essential infrastructure rapidly; on the other hand, industries need to prepare for the risk of deployment failures, rather than solely waiting for large-scale infrastructure to emerge. Our feasible supply scenarios provide compelling evidence of the urgency of demand-side actions and establish benchmarks for the required level of resource efficiency.},

Climate change is expected to further increase the likelihood and severity of future droughts. Simultaneously, population and industrial growth increases demand for drought-stressed water resources and energy, including electricity. In the US, nearly half of water withdrawals are for electricity generation, much of which comes from greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuel combustion. The result is a three-way tension among efforts to meet growing energy demands while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water withdrawals, a critical issue within the so-called water-energy nexus. We focus on this interaction within the electric sector by using a generation expansion planning model to explore the trade-offs. We show that large reductions in CO 2 emissions would probably increase water withdrawals for electricity generation in the absence of limits on water usage, and that simultaneous restriction of CO 2 emissions and water withdrawals requires a different mix of energy technologies and higher costs than one would plan to reduce either CO 2 or water alone. {\copyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Climate change is widely expected to increase weather related damage and the insurance claims that result from it. This will increase insurance premiums in a way that is independent of a customer's contribution to the causes of climate change. Insurance provides a financial mechanism that mitigates some of the consequences of climate change, allowing damage from increasingly large or frequent events to be repaired. We observe that the insurance industry could offset any increases in premiums due to climate change through a levy on insurance premiums for fossil-fuel producers for example, without needing government intervention or a new tax. We argue that an insuranceled levy or government-led carbon tax must acknowledge a modern industry's present carbon emissions and its fossil-fuel heritage (its ``carbon inheritance''), that is, it should recognise that fossil-fuel driven industrial growth has provided the innovations and conditions needed for them to exist and develop. These industries have inherited the benefits of past emissions, and we argue that they should also inherit some of the cost of those past emissions, as manifested through any statistical increase in weather-related damage due to climate change. A carbon-intensity weighted tax or levy on energy production is one mechanism that would recognise a modern industry's carbon inheritance, through increased energy costs of manufacturing and technology. It can be weighted to encourage the least polluting industries, and to discourage unnecessarily carbon-intense industries. The cost increases would initially be small, and will require an event attribution methodology to determine their size. A tax or levy can be phased in as the science of event attribution becomes sufficiently robust for each claim type, with the latter avoiding the need for government-led taxes, agreements, and intervention, through a global insurance-led response to climate change.},

The current study aims to evaluate the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of four ferromolybdenum production cases using inventory inputs from a process model based on mass and energy conservations. The total energy required for producing 1~tonne of FeMo can vary between 29.1~GJ/t FeMo and 188.6~GJ/t FeMo. Furthermore, the corresponding GHG emissions differ from 3.16 tCO2-eq/t FeMo to 14.79 tCO2-eq/t FeMo. The main variances are from the mining and beneficiation stages. The differences in these stages come from the beneficiation degree (ore grade) and the mine type (i.e., co-product from copper mining). Furthermore, the mine type has a larger impact on the total energy consumption and GHG emissions than the beneficiation degree. More specifically, FeMo produced as co-product from copper mining has a lower environmental impact measured as the energy consumption and GHG emission among all the four cases. The inventory, consumed energy or associated GHG emission is independent on the initial ore grade and mine type in the downstream production stages such as roasting and smelting. Also, transport has the least impact on the energy consumption and GHG emission among all production stages.},

The size and location of mine features can be determined from satellite imagery, but to date a systematic analysis of these features across commodities and countries has not been conducted. We created detailed maps of 295 mines producing copper, gold, silver, platinum group elements, molybdenum, lead-zinc, nickel, uranium or diamonds, representing the dominant share of global production of these commodities. The mapping entailed the delineation and classification of 3,736 open pits, waste rock dumps, water ponds, tailings storage facilities, heap leach pads, milling infrastructure and other features, totalling {\textasciitilde}3,633 km2. Collectively, our maps highlight that mine areas can be highly heterogeneous in composition and diverse in form, reflecting variations in underlying geology, commodities produced, topography and mining methods. Our study therefore emphasises that distinguishing between specific mine features in satellite imagery may foster more refined assessments of mine-related impacts. We also compiled detailed annual data on the operational characteristics of 129 mines to show via regression analysis that the sum area of a mine's features is mainly explained by its cumulative production volume (cross-validated R2 of 0.73). This suggests that the extent of future mine areas can be estimated with reasonable certainty based on expected total production volume. Our research may inform environmental impact assessments of new mining proposals, or provide land use data for life cycle analyses of mined products.},

  abstract = {In sustainability science, revising the paradigms that separate humans from nature is con\- sidered a powerful `leverage point' in pursuit of transformations. The coupled socialecological and human-environment systems perspectives at the heart of sustainability science have, in many ways, enhanced recognition across academic, civil, policy and business spheres that humans and nature are inextricably connected. However, in retaining substantialist assumptions where `social' and `ecological' refer to different classes of entity that interact, coupled systems perspectives insist on the inextricability of humans and nature in theory, while requiring researchers to extricate them in practice -- thus inadvertently reproducing the separation they seek to repair. Consequently, sustainability researchers are increasingly drawing on scholarship from the `relational turn' in the humanities and the social sciences to propose a paradigm shift for sustainability science: away from focusing on interactions between entities, towards emphasizing continually unfolding processes and relations. Yet there remains widespread uncertainty about the origins, promises and challenges of using relational approaches. In this paper, we identify four themes in relational thinking -- con\- tinually unfolding processes; embodied experience; reconstructing language and concepts; and ethics/practices of care -- and highlight the ways in which these are being drawn on in sustainability science. We conclude by critically discussing how relational approaches might contribute to (i) a paradigm shift in sustainability science, and (ii) transformations towards sustainability. Relational approaches foster more dynamic, holistic accounts of human-nature connectedness; more situated and diverse knowledges for decision-making; and new domains and methods of intervention that nurture relationships in place and practice.},

There are ongoing discussions about whether and how projects should be integrated into national climate change mitigation efforts under the Paris Agreement. One consideration is whether these projects have generated additional impacts over and above national policies and other measures. To help inform these discussions, we compare the crediting baselines established ex-ante by voluntary REDD+ projects in the Brazilian Amazon to counterfactuals constructed ex-post based on the quasi-experimental synthetic control method. We find that the crediting baselines assume consistently higher deforestation than counterfactual forest loss in synthetic control sites. This gap is partially due to decreased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon during the early implementation phase of the REDD+ projects considered here. This suggests that forest carbon finance must strike a balance between controlling conservation investment risk and ensuring the environmental integrity of carbon emission offsets. Relatedly, our results point to the need to better align project- and national-level carbon accounting.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Manganese is a metal used extensively in everyday life, particularly in structural steel. Despite the importance of manganese as an essential alloying element in steel and stainless steel, the environmental profile of manganese alloys lacked globally representative, primary industry data. The International Manganese Institute (IMnI) and Hatch completed the first global life cycle assessment (LCA) of manganese alloy production, providing environmental benchmarks and a firm foundation of accurate data with which to inform other industry-led initiatives. Methods: The study compiled primary data from 16 ore and alloy producers worldwide, covering 18~\% of global ore production and 8~\% of global alloy production for 2010. This peer-reviewed, ISO 14040 compliant LCA covers the cradle-to-gate life cycles of silicomanganese, ferromanganese, and refined ferromanganese. The study provides a comprehensive picture of global environmental performance, quantifying energy consumption, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), primary water use, and primary waste generation. A novel model architecture was devised to generate process, site, and cradle-to-gate LCAs for single and multiple sites simultaneously, extracting greater value from the LCA process by facilitating environmental and operational benchmarking within the industry. Results and discussion: The results of the study show that total GWP, AP, and POCP for 1~kg of average manganese alloy was 6.0~kg CO2e, 45~g SO2e, and 3~g C2H4e, respectively. Electricity demand and coal and coke consumption during smelting are the dominant operating parameters contributing to environmental performance. On-site air emission measures (GWP, POCP, NOX, and particulate matter (PM)) contributed 25 to 35~\% of total life cycle emissions. Overburden and waste rock were the most significant primary solid waste flows by mass. The study provides a resource for improvement at the global industry and site scales by establishing benchmarks, identifying hotspots, and quantifying the benefits of efficiency savings through process optimization. Conclusions: This LCA provides accurate primary data to improve steel and stainless steel product LCAs and communicate the environmental performance of the industry in quantitative terms. It facilitates dialogue between manganese producers and consumers through a shared understanding of the environmental profile of the industry. Through leveraging the study to identify hotspots within the manganese supply chain, producers can work both independently and collectively towards improving the environmental and economic performance of manganese alloys.},

We describe the sources of systemic complexity and highlight the role of risk assessments as a formal sense-making device that enables learning and organizing knowledge of the dynamic interplay between the climate-sensitive system and its (climatological) environment. We highlight boundary judgments as a core concern of risk assessments, helping to create islands of analytical and cognitive tractability in a complex, uncertain, and ambiguous world. We then point to three key concepts---boundary critique, multi-methodology, and second-order learning---as critical elements of contemporary risk assessment practice, and we weave these into an overarching framework to better account for systemic complexity in the assessment of climate risk.},

With climate change high up on the political and corporate agenda, carbon footprint calculations are in strong demand. Numerous approaches have been proposed to provide estimates, ranging from basic online calculators to sophisticated life-cycle- analysis or input-output-based methods and tools. Despite its ubiquitous use however, there is an apparent lack of academic definitions of what exactly a carbon footprint is meant to be. The scientific literature is surprisingly void of clarifications, despite the fact that countless studies in energy and ecological economics that could have claimed tomeasure a carbon footprint have been published over decades. This report explores the apparent discrepancy between public and academic use of the term carbon footprint and suggests a scientific definition based on commonly accepted accounting principles and modelling approaches. It addresses methodological question such as system boundaries, completeness, comprehensiveness, units and robustness of the indicator.},

Design/methodology/approach This case study presents the diverse PPBL activities that SOS offers on the undergraduate and the graduate levels and examines the institutional structures in place that support these activities. Data were collected through literature and document reviews, observations, interviews, student evaluations and faculty surveys. Findings The review of the PPBL program at SOS illustrates a case of successfully inaugurating a PPBL program in sustainability at a major university in the USA. Yet, a key challenge for this program and similar programs around the world is how to maintain the institutional momentum and make advances after the initial takeoff. SOS is attempting to address this issue by developing greater program cohesion and coordination, synthesizing past products and learning, monitoring and evaluating impacts, and developing PPBL training programs for faculty and graduate students. Practical implications The experiences and findings presented can help other programs to articulate the benefits of a PPBL initiative, anticipate implementation challenges and successfully support their own PPBL initiatives through adequate institutional structures. The review points to the fact that the major impact on both student learning and outcomes for partner organizations is achieved through a concerted effort by the organization as a whole. Successful PPBL programs require both top-down commitments from the administration and bottom-up drive from interested faculty and students. Originality/value This case study discusses the PPBL program at SOS. The findings can inform and support the ongoing transformation in sustainability education with the ultimate objective to build students' capacities to address and solve wicked sustainability problems in the real world, competently collaborating with partners from government, business and civil society.},

Participatory System Maps provide a general-purpose resource that can be used in many ways; however, knowing how to turn their complex view of a system into something actionable for evaluation purposes is difficult. The methodology outlined in this article gives this starting point and plots a path through from systems mapping to a Theory of Change evaluators can use. It allows evaluators to develop practical Theories of Change that take into account feedbacks, wider context and potential negative or unexpected outcomes.

We find that each evaluation method has distinctive strengths, as well as constraints on its application. We use these insights to propose a systematic evaluation framework combining multiple methods to establish the appropriateness, interpretability, credibility, and relevance of process-based IAMs as useful scientific tools for informing climate policy.

Yet, fund-level climate-related disclosures have focused on portfolio holdings, reducing the ability of investors to evaluate the impact of capital flows. In particular, as passive funds grow, there is a risk that capital is channelled into carbon-intensive assets through primary markets. To track carbon-intensive portfolio holdings and primary market transactions, and the role of passive funds within them, we construct a dataset of daily holdings for passive U.S. corporate bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from 2016 to 2021. We find that the carbon exposure and carbon intensity of ETF primary market transactions are associated with existing ETF portfolio holdings. We also find that the share of secondary market holdings and primary market transactions accounted for by passive ETFs is higher for fossil fuel bonds, and increases with bond-level carbon intensity. These findings indicate that the continued growth in passive funds could support carbon-intensive capital flows.},

The article focuses on how policy intersects with the specific legal requirements and a distinct investment culture that often constrain the ability of institutions to invest with impact. These barriers must be taken into account for the institutional role in impact investing to grow beyond the current limited activity. Careful coordination between policymakers and institutional investors will be essential in building private investment markets that deliver positive social impact. We concentrate on more narrowly construed impact investment policies. Examples include geographically targeted economic development, and energy-efficient real estate investments.},

Findings suggest that students believed that gaining knowledge of sustainability is essential for all accounting undergraduates, not just those who elect to follow a specialist module, and that problem-based learning is an appropriate and enabling method with which to introduce sustainability. It is also important for developing individual interest, building knowledge of various accounting, auditing, and reporting procedures, and motivating students. For those who wish to develop a sustainability in accounting module, a caveat is presented that delivery of sustainability within a core, single-semester module has potential implications for student motivation and depth of learning. Recommendations are made to help mitigate these potential issues and with the necessary amendments in place, the paper argues that sustainability should constitute a core module in all accounting programmes in the interests of students, the accounting profession, and society at large.},

Corn production is energy intensive and contributes to water quality degradation and global warming, thus affecting the environmental impact of corn-derived ethanol. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to quantify and compare the environmental impacts of three management strategies: tillage, fertilizer choices and the use of buffer strips to sequester nutrients. Detailed energy, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus inventories are compiled to represent corn production scenarios within the US Corn Belt. The LCA was developed using GREET 1.8 (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) and emission factors with statistical analyses to estimate energy consumption, associated air emissions, and aqueous nutrient runoff potentials. Results show that using manure fertilizers as opposed to synthetic fertilizers requires less energy, however the use of manure generates more CH4, N2O, CO2 and results in more variable concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus leaching from farmlands. No tillage emits less greenhouse gas emissions, sequesters more soil organic carbon and slightly reduces nutrient runoff compared with conventional tillage practices. Building buffer strips of certain widths is an efficient way to reduce N and P discharge to surrounding waters with minimal effect on the energy or global warming profile. Based on the results of the LCA studies, replacing conventional tillage with no till, and installing buffer strips can improve environmental performances of corn derived ethanol.},

In this paper, we present a systematic review of over 90 empirical studies that have applied behavioral change interventions based on social norms in field settings. Building on previous research about the sources of information that people use to understand social norms and other local determinants of behavior, we propose a framework organized along two axes that describe intervention context (situated interventions applied in the same context where the target behavior happens versus remote interventions that are applied away from that context) and type of normative information leveraged (interventions that provide summary information about a group versus interventions that expose participants to the opinions and behaviors of others). We also illustrate successful applications for each dimension, as well as the social, psychological and physical determinants of behavior that were leveraged to support change. Finally, based on our results, we discuss some of the elements and practical mechanisms that can be used by both researchers and practitioners to design more integral, effective and sustainable social norm intervention in the real world.},

Metals play an essential role in human life, and their demand will increase with global population and economic growth. Therefore, projecting future GHG emissions associated with metal production and exploring effective measures to alleviate GHG emissions are essential for achieving climate goals. This study projects the future GHG emissions associated with the primary and secondary production of six metals (aluminum, copper, iron, lead, nickel, and zinc) by considering the detailed metal cycles according to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Additionally, influential factors for GHG emissions in metal cycles are explored using decomposition and sensitivity analyses to reduce future GHG emissions. We show that future GHG emissions from metal production cannot be in line with the climate goal required to maintain the temperature change below 2 {$^\circ$}C under any SSP, even though the trends for GHG emissions from metal production are significantly different among the SSPs. Therefore, substantial efforts to reduce GHG emissions are required in addition to the transition to the sustainable socio-economic pathway. From a short-term perspective, lowering the per capita in-use metal stock level and GHG emission intensity of metal production is crucial, especially in middle income groups. From a long-term perspective, improving the recycling rate is a possible step after sufficient in-use metal stocks are accumulated for recycling. To achieve the climate goals for both short- and long-term GHG reductions in metal cycles, a combination of actions on these influential factors without delay is essential.},

  abstract = {Purpose Avoided emissions refer to greenhouse gas emission reductions that are a result of using a product or are emission removals due to a decision or an action. Although there is no uniform standard for calculating avoided emissions, market actors have started referring to avoided emissions as ``Scope 4'' emissions. By default, making a claim about Scope 4 emissions gives an appearance that this Scope of emissions is a natural extension of the existing and accepted Scope-based emissions accounting framework. The purpose of this study is to explore the implications of this assumed legitimacy. Design/methodology/approach Via a desktop review and interviews, we analyse extant Scope 4 company reporting, associated accounting methodologies and the practical implications of Scope 4 claims. Findings Upon examination of Scope 4 emissions and their relationship with Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, we highlight a dynamic and interdependent relationship between quantification, commensuration and standardization in emissions accounting. We find that extant Scope 4 assessments do not fit the established framework for Scope-based emissions accounting. In line with literature on the territorializing nature of accounting, we call for caution about Scope 4 claims that are a distraction from the critical work of reducing absolute emissions. Originality/value We examine the implications of assumed alignment and borrowed legitimacy of Scope 4 with Scope-based accounting because Scope 4 is not an actual Scope, but a claim to a Scope. This is as an act of accounting territorialization.},

More specifically, I examine how decision makers' identification with the source of the standards moderates compliance with different types of standards. Type refers to whether the accounting standard is descriptive or injunctive (i.e., prescriptive). Source refers to the entity promulgating the accounting standards. I conduct three experiments in which participants face a direct trade-off between reporting aggressively to maximize their personal wealth and reporting conservatively to adhere to a standard. I find that identification with the source causes less aggressive reporting for an injunctive standard, but when a standard is descriptive, identification has no effect or an opposite effect. When identification with the source is low, descriptive standards tend to work well compared to injunctive standards. With injunctive standards, persuasive factors, such as identification, likely influence financial managers' aggressive reporting behavior.},

Surface mining by the minerals industry is one driver of the changes in land cover, leading to loss of natural vegetation and top soils, and interruption of ecosystem service flows. This study investigates the effectiveness of remote sensing datasets to identify and map land cover changes, with the specific goal of understanding the impact of surface mining activities on land cover globally from 1980s to 2013. Diverse remote sensing datasets with long term observations are analyzed, including high-resolution images in Google Earth, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Index (VI) product and Defense Meteorological Satellites Program (DMSP)/Operational Linescan System (OLS) stable night-time light. The results indicated that after entering 21st century, North America (e.g., the United States and Canada) was the only continent to have more surface mining spots categorized as Shrink type (rehabilitated) rather than Expand type. South America (e.g., Chile and Brazil) and Asia (e.g., India and China) had the highest proportions of Expand Type of surface mining spots. Detailed demonstrations on how those remote sensing datasets could help in mining spot monitoring are presented.},

A three-year (2015-2017) inventory data was obtained from five commercial palm biodiesel producers in Malaysia. Methanol, acids and sodium methoxide (catalyst) were identified as three major contributors to the environmental impacts. Impact assessment showed that replacement of fossil-based methanol with biomethanol produced from biogas is the most preferred option, saving up to 63\% fossil resources and 22\% reduction in global warming impact. Allocation based on economic value was found more suitable compared to mass or energy content. This is because both palm biodiesel and crude glycerol differ in terms of economic value and being used in different applications.},

  abstract = {Purpose: In the booming electric vehicle market, the demand for refined cobalt is showing a blowout growth. China is the largest cobalt-refiner and cobalt-importer in the world. However, the life cycle inventory and potential environmental impact from cobalt refining in China have not been clearly illustrated. This paper builds a comprehensive inventory to support the data needs of downstream users of cobalt sulfate. A ``cradle-to-gate'' life cycle assessment was conducted to provide theoretical support to stakeholders. Methods: A life cycle assessment was performed based on ISO 14040 to evaluate the potential environmental impact and recognize the key processes. The system boundary of this study contains four stages of cobalt sulfate production: mining, beneficiation, primary extraction, and refining. Except for the experimental data used in the primary extraction stage, all relevant data are actual operating data. The normalization value was calculated based on the latest released global emission and extraction data. Results and discussion: Normalization results show that the potential impacts of cobalt refining were mainly concentrated in the fossil depletion and freshwater ecotoxicity categories. The beneficiation stage and the refining stage account for 72\% and 26\% of the total normalization value, respectively. The beneficiation stage needs to consume a lot of chemicals and energy to increase the cobalt content, due to the low grade of cobalt ore in China. Compared with cobalt concentrate, the use of cobalt-containing waste (e.g., cobalt waste from EV batteries) can ease endpoint impact by up to 73\%. With the application of the target electricity structure in 2050, the potential impact of China's cobalt sulfate production on global warming, fossil depletion, and particulates formation can be reduced by 24\%, 22\%, and 26\%, respectively. Conclusion: Findings indicate that the chemical inputs and electricity consumption are primary sources of potential environmental impact in China's cobalt sulfate production. Promoting the development of urban mines can reduce excessive consumption of chemicals and energy in the beneficiation stage. The environmental benefits of transforming the electricity structure and using more renewable energy to reduce dependence on coal-based power in the cobalt refining industry were revealed.},

Here, we analyze the trade-off between the decarbonization potential of the road transportation sector and its critical metal requirement from the demand-side perspective in 48 major countries committing to decarbonize their road transportation sectors aided by electric vehicles (EVs). Our results demonstrate that deploying EVs with 40--100\% penetration by 2050 can increase lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese demands by 2909--7513\%, 2127--5426\%, 1039--2684\%, and 1099--2838\%, respectively, and grow platinum group metal requirement by 131--179\% in the 48 investigated countries, relative to 2020. Higher EV penetration reduces GHG emissions from fuel use regardless of the transportation energy transition, while those from fuel production are more sensitive to energy-sector decarbonization and could reach nearly ``net zero'' by 2040.},

We used publicly available reports issued by two market leaders, DeBeers and ALROSA, to estimate water and energy use per carat of a rough diamond. The efficiency of the two most popular synthesis technologies for artificial diamonds-High-Pressure- High-Temperature (HPHT) and Microwave-assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (M-CVD)-was examined. We found that the modern HPHT presses, with open cooling circuits, consume about 36 kWh/ct when producing gem-quality and average-sized (near-) colorless diamonds. ALROSA and DeBeers use about 96 kWh/ct and 150 kWh/ct, respectively, including all energy required to mine. Energy consumption of M-CVD processes can be different and depends on technological conditions. Our M-CVD machine is the least energy-efficient, requiring about 215 kWh/ct in the single-crystal regime, using 2.45-GHz magnetron for the support synthesis. The M-CVD methods of individual synthetic companies IIa Technology and Ekati Mine are different from our results and equal 77 and 143 kWh/ct, respectively. Water consumption for the HPHT and M-CVD methods was insignificant: approximately zero and 0.002 m3/ct, respectively, and below 0.077 m3/ct for ALROSA-mined diamonds. This study touches upon the impact of the diamond production methods used on the carbon footprint.},

GEP accounting captures the use of many ecosystem services in production processes across the economy, which are then valued in terms of their benefits to society. GEP has five key elements that make it transparent, trackable, and readily understandable: (1) a focus on nature's contributions to people; (2) the measurement of ecosystem assets as stocks and ecosystem services as flows; (3) the quantification of ecosystem service use; (4) an understanding of ecosystem service supply chains through value realization; and (5) the disaggregation of benefits across groups. Correspondingly, a series of innovative policies based on GEP have been designed and implemented in China. The theoretical and practical lessons provided by these experiences can support continued policy innovation for green and inclusive development around the world.},

Some economies have begun to reduce emissions while continuing to grow, but this decoupling is not fast enough to achieve global climate targets. Subnational climate actions seem to be crucial for the achievement of these targets. Here, we uncover the effectiveness of subnational efforts by estimating decoupling rates and CO2 emission intensities over the last three decades for over 1,500 subnational regions, encompassing 85\% of global emissions, using global data on reported economic output and gridded production-based emissions. Thirty percent of regions with available data have fully decoupled, with higher-income and historically carbon-intensive regions exhibiting higher rates of decoupling and declining emission intensity. Countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development with greater spending on subnational climate actions show higher decoupling rates, as do subnational regions in EU countries where climate policies have been implemented, highlighting the effectiveness of subnational policies. Moreover, subnational analysis reveals greater variance of decoupling rates within national boundaries than between them and that countries with weaker governance typically show higher variance of decoupling within their borders. If recent rates of production-based carbon decoupling continue, less than half of subnational regions would reach net-zero before 2050, even when accounting for observed acceleration via socioeconomic development and assuming no interregional carbon leakage.}

This book delivers a methodological approach to designing and assessing sustainable financial systems. It provides an original contribution by prioritizing ESG factors in the decision-making process of financial institutions and identifying their impact on sustainable financial systems. The author argues that to achieve financial stability, it is necessary to have in place mechanisms designed to prevent financial problems from becoming systemic and/or threatening the stability of the financial and economic system, while maintaining (or not undermining) the economy's ability to sustain growth and perform its other functions. The book primarily takes a simulation and experimental approach. It is the first book to take such a comprehensive look at sustainable financial systems as opposed to sustainable finance in general.

  abstract = {Compound weather and climate events describe combinations of multiple climate drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk. Although many climaterelated disasters are caused by compound events, the understanding, analysis, quantification and prediction of such events is still in its infancy. In this Review, we propose a typology of compound events and suggest analytical and modelling approaches to aid in their investigation. We organize the highly diverse compound event types according to four themes: preconditioned, where a weather-d riven or climate-d riven precondition aggravates the impacts of a hazard; multivariate, where multiple drivers and/or hazards lead to an impact; temporally compounding, where a succession of hazards leads to an impact; and spatially compounding, where hazards in multiple connected locations cause an aggregated impact. Through structuring compound events and their respective analysis tools, the typology offers an opportunity for deeper insight into their mechanisms and impacts, benefiting the development of effective adaptation strategies. However, the complex nature of compound events results in some cases inevitably fitting into more than one class, necessitating soft boundaries within the typology. Future work must homogenize the available analytical approaches into a robust toolset for compound-e vent analysis under present and future climate conditions.},

We review definitions of `nature-positive', highlight differences between `nature-positive' and previous iterations of organizational biodiversity strategies (e.g. net positive impact) and propose four key elements for `nature-positive' strategies: 1) demonstrating positive biodiversity outcomes across the entire value chain (``scope''); 2) buy-in throughout the entire organization (``mainstreaming''); 3) integrated consideration of different components of nature (e.g. both biodiversity and climate; ``integration''); and 4) measurable outcomes against a fixed baseline aligned with overall societal goals (e.g. post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework; ``ambition''). We analyse trends in biodiversity commitments of the Global Fortune 100 companies and firms that have made recent `net impact' commitments, evaluating alignment with these elements and where possible assessing their evolution since 2016. Uptake of biodiversity commitments has increased since 2016, but with limited progress towards adopting measurable, time-bound commitments (an increase from 5 to 10/100 Fortune 100 firms from 2016 to 2021). We review barriers to business implementation of strategies that can deliver socially equitable and `nature-positive' outcomes. Major improvements are needed in data availability and transparency, regulation and sector-wide coordination that creates level playing fields and prevents impact leakage. Transformative action is required to create production and consumption systems that actively enhance nature.},
